    Some information regarding "PCC-ID" board for PCC-E
=================================================================================================


----------- Classical case: Assigning PCC-E numbers using daisy chain

There can be several PCCs in the system. In order to give PCCs sequential numbers they need 
to be connected via "daisy chain" cables. PCCs boards that close to the "Master PCC" in daisy chain terms
get lower numbers (PccIDs). Master PCC is connected to the Encoder and PD sensor.
This configuration is well described in Meteor documetation (corresponding application notes) and shown on 
the picture below:

    |                 |  |                 | |                 |
    | Pcc1(master)    |  | Pcc2            | | Pcc3            |
    +----------o------+  +------^--o-------+ +------^----------+
      ^  ^     |                |  |                |

      |  |              daisy chain link                        
      |  |                                                      
      |  +-- PD                                                 
      +------Encoder                                            


This approach suits the vast majority of the use cases. The trouble begins when it is not possible to have 
a physical daisy chain link between some PCCs. For example, several print bars, made of multiple heads each.
It is possible to connect PCCs that serve one PrintBar with a daisy chain, but different PrintBars can be situated
too far away from each other and can't be connected via daisy chain cable.

In order to mitigate such issues it might be worth assigning PCCs numbers manually, but it is not really easy, because
PCC numbers can be [1..254] and keeping track of them will be problematic.


----------- PCC clusters and "PCC-ID" boards

A different approach had been applied: Instead of assigning each PCC its number individually, it is possible to assign
"PCC Base number" to a sort of "PCC cluster", within one cluster there should be a daisy chain that allow PCCs enumeration,
and it is possible to have sevaral such "PCC clusters". 
This can be done by using a small "PCC-ID" board that is plugged into a connector an a PCC-E board. 

Each "PCC-ID" board has a 16-position rotary switch with positions marked as 0..F (0..15 in decimal).
This switch is used to set PCC "ClusterId", which in turn used to working out real PCC number.

PCC number is calculated as follows: PccNumber = (ClusterId * 8) + (PccPosition in DaisyChain).

In Meteor system PccNumber should be in range: [1..254]

So, it is possible to have upto 8 PCCs in a daisy chain (all PCCs in such "cluster" must have the same "ClusterId".
And up to 32 such "PCC clusters".

Configuration example:

      |  |                                                            |  |

      +------Encoder                                                  +------Encoder


In this example we have 2 "clusters": [PCC1..PCC3] and [PCC9..PCC10]. Each cluster can have its own ProductDetect sensor
and the encoder. PCC1 and PCC9 start cluster daisy chain and, so they are "Masters", Encoder and PD sensors connected to 
them. 
In Meteor config file it is set up as follows:

[Controller1]
Master = 1          ; This controller is Master



[Controller9]
Master = 1          ; This controller is Master


It is also possibe to specify different PD forward and reverse offsets for master PCCs.


Some tips:

It might be useful to use "identify PCC" button in Monitor ("Status" Tab) to identify some PCCs.
Pressing this button makes blue LED inside it blink.
