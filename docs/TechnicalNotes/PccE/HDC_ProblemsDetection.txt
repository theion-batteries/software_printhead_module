    Some information on the way of detecting/signaling hardware problems with HDCs 

=================================================================================================

There are sevaral types of hardware problems, which can happen with HDC and the head it drives.
These problems can be detected by Meteor and reported to the other system via signals on PCC GPIO.

Currently following problems can be identified / handled:

    * "HDC status alarms" It is a very head-specific feature, where the problems are indicated by 
        some bits set in HDC status word. PCC/HDC FPGA monitors some of the critical parameters and 
        sets certain bits to indicate the problem. For example, it addresses Head / Amplifier overtemperature,
        waveform problems, some voltages failures etc.
        These type of conditions usually result in HDC/head power cut off and error message logged, e.g
        "*** [PCC:1,HDC:4] Status Alarm: Amplifier Overtemperature" or similar

    * "HDC drop out" This might happen when connectivity between PCC and HDC is lost, e.g HDC cable 
       is unplugged live and similar.
       This results in HDC powered off and error message like following:
       "*** [PCC:1,HDC:4] has dropped out. HdcState:0xd(ST_RUNNING), StatusBits:0x1fffffff"

---- GPIO signalling on HDC error conditions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In normal circumstances nothing apart from error messages and abnormal HDC power down happens.
On the other hand, Meteor system can be configured to issue a hardware signal on PCC GPIO connector when 
HDC hardware problems detected, as described above.

To enable this feature it is necessary:

    * select PCC GPIO signal[1..4] to be used. Value 0 (default) means "don't use GPIO"
    
        [System]
        ; PCC output signal 1..4 to use for indicating HDC hardware errors. 0(default) to disable GPIO usage
        HdcDropOutGpio = 1 ; use output 1 on PCC GPIO connector

    * Optionally select GPIO "active" level. 
      By default "inactive" level is +5V (GP out is open-drain and pulled up by resistor) and "active" is 0V.
      This can be changed by inverting GP Output by using  "GpioOutInvertMask" parameter:
  
        [Test]
        GpioOutInvertMask = 0x00 ; GPOut1..4 are not inverted 
        
The way it works is as follows:

    * on system start up and HDC power ON selected GP output is set to "inactive" state
    * it stays in "inactive" state if there are no problems forever
    * if HDC problem is discovered, Meteor logs error message and activates selected GP output on a PCC connector
      This output stays in "active" state unless all HDCs are powered down and up again.
