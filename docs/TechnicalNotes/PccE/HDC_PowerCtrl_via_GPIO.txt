    Some information regarding a feature that allows to control HDC power via PCC GPIO

=================================================================================================


It is possible to enable feature that allows controlling HDC (head) power via PCC GPIO input.
If enabled, then all HDCs on ALL PCCs be forced to power ON when selected GP input has INACTIVE state 
(i.e left floating or pulled to +3.3 volts). And as soon as that selected GP input becomes ACTIVE (pulled to 0V)
ALL HDCs on ALL PCCs will be powered OFF.


To configure this feature "HeadPowerIn" key should be used in a config file in [Head] section.
    
"HeadPowerIn" key values are:
    0       - default, this feature is disabled
    1..4    - use corresponding PCC GP input[1..4] that will be used to control HDCs power.


For example:

    [Xaar2001]
    HeadPowerIn = 1 ;-- use PCC GP Input 1 to control HDCs power. Applies to ALL PCCs and HDCs in the system

This feature is currently supported by following print head types:

    HT_STARFIRE (Dimatix SG1024)
    
    HT_KJ4
    HT_K1200
    HT_K150
    HT_K300
    HT_K600

    HT_HSS      (Xaar 1001, 1002, 1003)
    HT_Xaar2001 (Xaar 2001/2002)


When "HeadPowerIn" functionality is used, the controlling application should not use the PrinterInterface
commands which control head power (PiSetHeadPower or SIG_HDPOWER).

If MetPrint is being used as the application software, by default it will always try to power on the print
heads when it sees that PCC hardware is connected.  

This behaviour can be changed by adding

   [Application] DisableHeadPower = 1 

to the configuration file, which prevents MetPrint from using the head power API commands.
