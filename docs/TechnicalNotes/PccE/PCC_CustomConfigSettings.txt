    Some information on custom settings for particular PCCs in Meteor Config file

=================================================================================================

Usually Meteor config file contains a number of "Global" sections with data that applies to all PCCs in the system.
For example, [Encoder], [ProductDetect] and some other. 
This might be a problem, especially for mixed-head types system, where different PCCs needs different 
settings. It is also applicable to multi-master systems as well.

There is a way (though pretty far from ideal) to specify _some_ settings for a particullar PCC.
These settings have special names and should be placed in [ControllerX] section.

List of these settings:


[ControllerX]
EncoderMultiplier=...  ; overrides value from [Encoder]->Multiplier
EncoderDivider   =...  ; overrides value from [Encoder]->Divider
PrintClock       =...  ; overrides value from [Encoder]->PrintClock
EncoderInvert    =...  ; overrides value from [Encoder]->Invert


PdOffset    =... ; overrides value from [ProductDetect]->Xoffset
PdOffsetRev =... ; overrides value from [ProductDetect]->XoffsetRev
PdYOffset   =... ; overrides value from [ProductDetect]->Yoffset
PdActiveLow =... ; overrides value from [ProductDetect]->ActiveLow
AutoPd      =... ; overrides value from [ProductDetect]->AutoPd


Tickle  =... ; overrides value from [System]->Tickle

;-- these are some PCC-specific settings, check out documentation for their meaning
FireOut
BlankDocOut
InImageOut
PdOut

;-- these are some obscured KJ4 settings
PixelMode
DSEL


;-- there are also some sort-control settings, but they are beyond of this document scope
