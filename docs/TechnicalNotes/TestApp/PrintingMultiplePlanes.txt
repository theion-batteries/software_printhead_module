Some information on how to send images to a different colour planes using TestApp
=================================================================================================

This is not a really trivial task, as TestApp has never been designed as a working tool. But it is good for testing.

Steps required:

1.  find out how many colour planes you are going to use. Take a look at your config file, [Planes] section.
2.  "Job" tab, "Job in progress" pane, tick on "Multiple planes" checkbox.
3.  Goto "Planes" tab, enter correct number of planes you want to use in "Plane count" box below.
3.1 Enter file names you are going to assign to the selected planes in "Plane[..]" "File[..]" controls.
    These settings are persistent and saved in Windows registry.

4.  return to "Job" tab, hit "Send FDoc" button, all images will be sent to PrintEngine.
