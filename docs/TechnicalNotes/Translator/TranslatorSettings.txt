TranslatorSettings.txt
----------------------

The Meteor translator is the part of the Meteor PrintEngine which:

- maps each row of pixels in an incoming raster image to a print head nozzle
- adjusts the image according to the X separation between nozzle rows on the print head
- adjusts for other print head parameters as necessary, for example the order in which the head receives print data

This file lists the configuration file (.cfg) settings which are available for configuring the Meteor translator

Quite often, these settings will not need to be changed from their default values.

[Translator]
MaxThreads = 0                      ; Limit the number of threads used by the translator
                                    ; If zero, the maximum number of translator threads is the maximum number of concurrent CPU threads

ProcessorAffinity = 0               ; Optional hexadecimal bitmask restricting the logical processors which the translator threads can run on
                                    ; e.g. on an 8 core system, 0xF0 forces the translator threads to run on logical processors 4-8
                                    ; If zero, the translator threads can run on any processor

The fast translator is heavily optimised, which means there is a small risk of errors in some print modes

If it appears that the translator is processing images incorrectly, the following test parameters can be
used to reduce the optimisation level of parts of the translation process

Please contact support@meteorinkjet.com to help investigate the problem if you need to use these parameters to correct print defects

When printing very small images, better performance may be achieved by disabling the fast translator.  This is a trade off between
the additional overhead in setting up the fast translator versus the amount of time spent processing; the point where it is
better to disable the fast translator will vary depending on the PC spec and the size of the images.

A few print heads, such as the QS_256, can be used at a sabre angle.  When a sabre angle is used, the fast translator is not available.


[Translator]
DisableFastTranslator = 0           ; Set to 1 to disable fast translation
DisableSimdTranslator = 0           ; Set to 1 to disable SIMD translator processing
DisableParallelTranslator = 0       ; Set to 1 to disable multi-threaded translation
DisableSourceStitchMask = 0         ; Set to 1 to disable fast head stitching
DisableExtendedSimdTranslator = 0   ; Set to 1 to disable non-aligned print line SIMD optimisations
DisableReuseSegments = 0            ; Set to 1 to disable same-size image memory reuse optimisations

[System]
CmdBufSizeDwords = 15728640         ; Size of each PrinterInterface to PrintEngine print data buffer
                                    ; This can be increased from the default of 60MB to accomodate larger images if required
                                    ; Changing this parameter requires a restart of all Meteor software

[Test]
TestThreadedTranslator = 1          ; Legacy parameter, which enables multi-threaded translator processing when DisableFastTranslator = 0
                                    ; This parameter will be removed in future versions of software

[Test]
TestImageTranspose = 1              ; Deprecated parameter, used to enable fast translation in Meteor versions v4.2 and earlier
                                    ; This parameter should no longer be used
