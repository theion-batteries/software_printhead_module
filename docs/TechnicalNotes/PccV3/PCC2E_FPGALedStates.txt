    Some information regarding PCC2-E FPGA LED states
=================================================================================================

PCC2-E among others LEDs has those ones:


LED_Green1  near big FPGA chip
LED_Green2  near big FPGA chip
LED_Amber1  near big FPGA chip
LED_Amber2  near big FPGA chip


LED_Blue(near Eth. connector)

These LEDs used to indicate PCC state and some activity, as described below:


---------------------------------------------------
--      PrintApp LED states
---------------------------------------------------

LED_Green1 FPGA heartbeat. 

LED_Green2 PrintApp heartbeat, around 800ms flashing. Flashes when PrintApp starts main loop, i.e.
           all systems are initialised and PrintEngine fully connected. 


LED_Amber1 Network stack state:
           ON           - Network stack is being initilaised
           Fast flash   - Network stack init Ok and we are asking DHCP server for IP address (in progress)
           OFF          - Network stack is fully running

LED_Amber2 Application type, OFF for PrintApp  



LED_Blue  states:  
           OFF          - normal working state
           Fast flash   - Something is wrong with PCC software: hang or crashed or in a some bad state
           Slow flash   - "Identify PCC" command received



---------------------------------------------------
--      LoaderApp LED states
---------------------------------------------------

LED_Green1 FPGA heartbeat. 

LED_Green2 Flashes when LoaderApp receives command from the PrintEngine or other client


LED_Amber1 Network stack state:
           ON           - Network stack is being initilaised
           Fast flash   - Network stack init Ok and we are asking DHCP server for IP address (in progress)
           OFF          - Network stack is fully running

LED_Amber2 Application type, flashing for LoaderApp  


LED_Blue  states:  
           OFF          - normal working state
           Fast flash   - Something is wrong with PCC software: hang or crashed or in a some bad state




---------------------------------------------------
--      BootApp LED states
---------------------------------------------------

LED_Green1 FPGA heartbeat. 

LED_Green2  Flashes when BootApp receives command from the PrintEngine or other client


LED_Amber1 Network stack state:
           ON           - Network stack is being initilaised
           Fast flash   - Network stack init Ok and we are asking DHCP server for IP address (in progress)
           OFF          - Network stack is fully running

LED_Amber2 Application type, ON for BootApp  


LED_Blue  states:  
           OFF          - normal working state
           Fast flash   - Something is wrong with PCC software: hang or crashed or in a some bad state
