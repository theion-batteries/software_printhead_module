    Some information regarding configuring PCC-E (PCC_FPGA_V2) and PCC2-E (PCC_FPGA_V3) systems
=================================================================================================

Meteor can support following configurations (from physical connetion and config file point of vews):

    * Legacy: All PCCs are PCC-E type (PccFpga Version2)
    * All PCCs are PCC2-E type (PccFpga Version3)
    * a mixture of PCC-E + PCC2-E boards (PccFpga Version2 and Version3)

The vast majority of settings in the config file are PCC - type independand, but in some cases the user will have 
to specify in the config file which PCC board in the system is PCC-E and which is PCC2-E.
It is not possible to plug-and-play and autodetect PCC types automatically.

Scenarios:

---- Legacy: All PCCs are PCC-E type (PccFpga Version2)
Standard way, the settins in Meteor config files are:

    [System]
    PccType = "PCCE" ;-- it specifies that ALL PCCs are PCC-E


---- All PCCs are PCC2-E type (PccFpga Version3)

    1. The simplest way is to use following settings:    

    [System]
    PccType = "PCC2E";-- it specifies that ALL  PCCs are PCC2-E


    2. More complicated way (see notes below about mixing PCC types)

    [System]
    PccType = "PCCE" ;-- it specifies that ALL PCCs are PCC-E

    [DefaultParameterValues]
    PccFpgaVer = 3   ;-- this key overrides PCC FPGA vesion GLOBALLY, so, ALL PCCs are now considered PCC2-E


---- a mixture of PCC-E + PCC2-E boards (PccFpga Version2 and Version3)

    In this case the user will have to explicitly specify which PCC type is which. For this it is 
    necessary to use a parameter: "PccFpgaVer" its value is:
    
        2 - PCC-E type (PccFpga Version2)
        3 - PCC2-E type (PccFpga Version3)                                                           
    

    The following example shows how to set PCC:1 as PCC-E and PCC:2 as PCC2-E
    --------------------------------------

    [System]
    PccType = "PCCE" ;-- it specifies that ALL PCCs are PCC-E


    [Planes]
    Plane1 = 1:1   ; Configure in PCC:1
    Plane2 = 2:1   ; Configure in PCC:2

    [Controller1]
    PccFpgaVer = 2 ; PCC:1 is explicitly PCC-E (though this line is redundant because of setting in [System])

    [Controller2]
    PccFpgaVer = 3 ; PCC:2 is explicitly PCC2-E (overrides setting in [System] and [DefaultParameterValues])
