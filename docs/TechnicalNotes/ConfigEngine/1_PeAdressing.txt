--- Main terminology:

    - "PCC" stands for "Printer Controller Card" and in it is the top-level controller that is connected to a host PC
        via USB or Ethernet. PCC drives several HDCs.
    
    - "HDC" means "Head driver card" and each HDC drives one or several physical print heads.

    - "Head" a physical printhead.

    - "JA" or "Jetting Assembly" This term describes some LOGICAL part of the print head. In general case it is not possible
        to establish definite relationship between "Jetting Assembly" and any type of head physical structure. JA structure usually
        derived from head configuring point of view (voltages, waveforms) and doesn't have to be direcly related to head's
        nozzle rows.

--- Some additional terminology that can be found in our documentation:

    - Nozzle Row:   a single vertical row of nozzles that has its own "fire" signal (E.g. RG5 head has 4 classical nozzle rows). 

    - Print Module: some heads have several parallel (but interlaced in Y direction) nozzle rows that have a common
                    "fire" signal. So, it is not a single row of nozzles.  Example: KM1024 head

    - HDC row:      Mostly for internal use. HDC doesn't need a knowledge of how many heads it drives, it drives 
                    "Nozzle rows". E.g. The same HDC can drive 2 heads with 2 nozzle rows or 1 head with 4 nozzle rows.
                    Higher level software (PrintEngine) cares about how all HDC rows assigned to physical heads on 
                    this HDC. (And this isn't straightforward!)

    - PDC:          "Printer Driver Card" Sometimes it makes sense to make a single combined board that contains
                    PCC and some number of HDCs on it (E.g. some Kyocera PDCs). This configuration still fits the 
                    picture above. 


--- Physical limitations:
    - Max. number of PCCs is 255  [PCC1...PCC255]
    - One PCC can drive upto 8 HDCs [HDC1..HDC8]
    - Each HDC can  drive upto 8 "HDC rows", it can be 8 heads with one "nozzle row", 4 heads with 2 "nozzle rows" etc.
    - Max. number of JAs per head is 16


--- PE Address 

In order to address any part of this system (PCC, HDC or anything downto individual JA) so called "PE-Addressing" 
("PE" stands for "PrintEngine") scheme was introduced. This is just 4 numbers in a form:  "PCC-HDC-Head-JA"

For example PEAddress [3-4-2-1] means "PCC3,HDC4,Head2,JA1".
It is possible to address groups of items in PE-Address hierarchy. For this a special value "0" meaning "Any" or "*" is
used. Note that concrete a PCC/HDC/Head/JA can't have index 0.

For example, 
[3-4-2-1]  means "PCC3,HDC4,Head2,JA1" all parts are fully specified, so, this addres is called "fully specified"
[3-4-2-0] or [3-4-2-*] means "All JAs" for PCC3,HDC4,Head2
[3-4-0-0] or [3-4-*-*] means "All JAs" an all heads for  PCC3,HDC4
[3-0-0-0] or [3-*-*-*] means "All JAs" an all heads on all HDCs driven by PCC3
[0-0-0-0] or [*-*-*-*] means "All JAs" an all heads on all HDCs for all PCCs in the system.

It is not possible to use addresses like [3-4-*-1] (JA1 for all heads on PCC3, HDC4) or [*-*-*-1] (JA1 for whole system).
This is because such cases are really rare in normal use and make everything very complicated.
No one usually needs such sort of addressing, if you find out that you need addressing like [3-4-*-1], than it is likely
possible that you are doing something wrong.

--- "User" vs "Internal" PE Address representations

All "PE Address" information mentioned above related to a "User" mode. In this case all numbering, like PCC number, HDC etc.
start from 1 and 0 has a special meaning "ANY".
This is because all things in Meteor config file are counted from one, and it is simpler for the user to think this way.


Inside PrintEngine all objects are numbered starting from 0, and 255 (or 0xFF in hex) has a special meaning "ANY".
So, the addressing is absolutely the same, but all indices are less by 1 and value "ANY" looks different.
Also, objects indices are in hexadecimal format. 
This form of PE Addressing can be seen in PrintEngine error messages and when some additional logging categories enabled 
(like "ConfigEngine").


In order to distinguish between different forms of "PE Address", they are recorded and displayed slighly differently:

[33-04-02-00]   "User" format, means "All JAs" for PCC33,HDC4,Head2
[21:03:01:FF]   "Internal" format, means the same, all numbers in hex


For example, following log snippet shows both representations of the same PE Address:

16:42:31.432 CConfigEngine::GetFpParam(04:00:00:01, Id:0x121 'WF_VScale_Mode', DefVal:2) => 2
16:42:31.432 CConfigEngine::GetFpParam(04:00:00:01, Id:0x122 'WF_VScale_Coeff', DefVal:1) => 1
16:42:31.432 ### Scaling WF for:[05-01-01-02] Mode:2, coeff:1.000000 
16:42:31.432 ### WF range for:[05-01-01-02] is [-25.000V, -0.500V]
