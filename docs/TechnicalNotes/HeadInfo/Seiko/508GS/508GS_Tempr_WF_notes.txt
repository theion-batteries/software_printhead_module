Some information regarding Seiko 508GS waveforms / head temperatures etc.    
=================================================================================================


FX2 code that converts 8-bit DAC value to 10x scaled head temperature uses some sort of
quadratic approximation, like: T = 0.008716407x^2 - 6.475387458x + 1136.921904303, and
in general: T = Coef_A*x^2 - Coef_B*x + Coef_C

These A, B, C coefficients depend on thermistor itself, HDC thermisttor amplifier etc.
In theory, they can be hardcoded once and forewer.

On the other hand, board schematics can change and therefore we need to be able to change
these coefficients on per-PCC basis.
So, those coefficients can be set in the Meteor config file.

By default, if nothing is set, FX2 code will use default hardcoded values.
In order to set other A, B, C coefficient values it is necessary to place folllowing lines in to the
config file, for the specific ControllerX

[ControllerX]
TempCalcParams = 571, 424371, 74509314 ;- def. values from FW for A, B, C coefficients     

This parameter key is a list of 3 values that correspond to A, B and C coefficients scaled 2^16 times.
I.e. A = 571/65356 == 0.008736764796 

If all of these parameters or any of them is 0, then they are ignored and default hardcoded values are used.
Be careful with the numbers you place there, it is quite possible to make head temperature calculations 
invalid if wrong parameter values specified.

In order to apply A,B,C coefficients value changes, the printEngine should be re-initialised.

Also, log can contain lines like this:
PrintEngine::T508GsHead::DoSendTempCalcCoefficients() PCC:0, Using Temp.Calc.Coefs, A:571, B:424371, C:74509314
This can be useful for checking what values sent to the concrete PCC.
