    Some information on "Hadware revisions" and "Head sub-types" for Seiko RC1536 head driven by HDC-2Sii1536

=================================================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------
--- HDC-2Sii1536 Hardware revisions and "Fast LVDS"

    Currently there are two types of HDC-2Sii1536:

        * ones with HDC hardwre revision prior to "RevH". They do not support "fast LVDS" feature and 
          their data bandwidth is slightly limited.

        * HDCs with hardwre revision "RevH" and onwards. They support "fast LVDS" and therefore have better 
          performance. Also, these revisions support aqueous head types recently announced by Seiko (see below). 


Unfortunately, it is not possible to auto-detect which HDC revision is used, so, this needs to be specified in 
Meteor config file. It is possible to mix different HDC revisions within one PCC, but they have to be configured
as "old revision" ones and such configuration doesn't gain much. In order to use "New revision" HDCs' features,
given PCC should drive only HDCs with "RevH" and onwards.

--- specifying HDC hardware revision in the Meteor config file:

All default settings specify "old revision" HDCs. So, if you don't need new features, you don't need to do anything.
HDC-2Sii1536 Hardware revision is set by "HdcHwRevision" key that can be located in [RC1536] (global value) or 
[ControllerX] (per-PCC settings) sections. Note that key value in [ControllerX] affects ALL HDCs connected to this PCC. 

    Valid values are:
        1: (default) specifies HDC revisions before "RevH". It will work on ALL HDC revisions, but doesn't 
           provide any new features. 
 
        2: specifies HDC revisions "RevH" and onwards. It will work only on HDC RevH and onwards. For older 
           revisions HDCs simply will not powerd on


        all other values are invalid and will cause errors.



--- Configuration example:

    [RC1536]
    HdcHwRevision = 2   ;-- use "RevH" for the whole system as the default value
 
    [Controller1]
    HdcHwRevision = 1   ;-- use "old revision" HDCs on PCC1  

    [Controller2]
    ;HdcHwRevision = 1  ;-- value is commented out, will use one from [RC1536] (2)


summary: if you don't need any features that are provided by HDCs with the "RevH" and onwards, then you don't need
to change anything.



And now comes the most interesting part...

----------------------------------------------------------------
--- Seiko RC1536 head sub-types.

Seiko has recently introduced some new variants of RC1536 head that can be used with Aqueous inks.
There is a little catch though: now using a certain variant of print head + certain variant of ink + a certain 
waveform can PHYSICALLY damage the head. You can discuss this with Seiko.

First of all, new RC1536 variants that can be used with aqueous inks can be driven by HDC-2Sii1536 "RevH" and onwards only,
(see above). Thus, a proper "HdcHwRevision" value msut be specified in Meteor config file.

Then, the user MUST specify RC1536 "Head sub-type" or variant in Meteor config file otherwise there will be errors logged
and printing will be disabled. 

Following "Head sub-types" are currently supported:
    
    1:  classic non-aqueous variant, for UV/oil based inks.     Heads: RC1536-M, RC1536-L
    2:  aqueous variant running with WFM0 disabled (see below)  Heads: RCA1536-M, RCA1536-L
    3:  aqueous variant running with WFM0 enabled (weird case when non-aqueous ink is used in aqueous head)
      

-- Head variants and waveform compatibility.
    
N.B For the detailed WF description see "WF_Info.txt" file. If you take a look into one of the waveform files, 
e.g. "SampleRc1536Waveform.txt", you will see that it usually contains description of 9 "waveforms": waveform0..8,
they in turn a just sequence of 0 and 1.

Important! aqueous RC1536 variants must have "waveform0" disabled, i.e. having all values set to 0.
"SampleRc1536Waveform.txt" file is an example of this, "Standard_Oil.txt" is the opposite, it can't be used for
aqueous inks.  

For head sub-type 2 waveform file is checked, and if it has non-zero "waveform0" values, the error message will 
be logged and printing will be disabled.


"Head sub-type" can be specified for the whole system,  concrete PCC, concrete HDC and even head. I.e. HDC-2Sii1536
can drive 2 heads with different sub-types.

When properly configured, you can find something like following lines in Meteor log: 

    ### [PCC:1,HDC:4] has hardware RevH and onwards. Head sub-type must be specified 
    ### non-aqueous head variant:1 (RC/RCH) is specified for[PCC:1,HDC:4,Head:1]
    ### aqueous head variant:2 (RCA) running with WFM0 disabled is specified for[PCC:1,HDC:4,Head:2]



--- Configuration example:

    [RC1536]    
    HdcHwRevision = 2   ;-- use "RevH" for the whole system as the default value


    [DefaultParameterValues]
    HeadSubType = 1 ; system-default: use classic non-aqueous variant, for UV/oil based inks. 

    [Controller1]
    HeadSubType = 1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1 ;-- 8 values for HDC1..HDC8 on PCC1. All heads on HDC3 have sub-type 2 

    
    [HeadDriver1:1]     ;--- settings specific for PCC1:HDC1
    HeadSubType = 1,2   ;-- PCC1:HDC1,Head1 has sub-type1, PCC1:HDC1,Head2 has sub-type2


--- some notes

HDC-2Sii1536 can drive 2 heads. If some head is not physically connected to the HDC, then it is possible that 
the sytem will try to access it anyway to read some specific information regarding the head sub-type (aqueous/normal).
In this case the read will fail because there is no head and error like following will be logged:
"*** Status: [PCC:1,HDC:4] Error: i2c read Head2 Wf setting"
Which indicates read failure (ehad not present) for Head1 on Pcc:1, HDC:4.
Actually, there is nothing wrong with it, but if you use just one head on HDC and do not want to see errors like that, 
then you will have to remove the absent head from the [planes] section in the Meteor config file.
This will tell the system that the head is not present at all.
