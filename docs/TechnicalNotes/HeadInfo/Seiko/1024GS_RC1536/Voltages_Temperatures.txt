Some information on voltages/temperatures control for Seiko 1024GS/RC1536 heads.

=================================================================================================


----- head voltages control

Both these heads have 4 voltages: VRA, VRB, VRC, VRD. These correspond to head's "Jetting assemblies" JA0..JA3
These voltages are defined by CPEX_HeadVoltage parameter. It can be placed in any of 
[DefaultParameterValues], [ControllerX], [HeadDriverX:Y], [HeadX:Y:Z] sections of the Meteor config file.
This allows specifying voltages down to the individual JA
The default value is 29.0V.

Config. file example:

    [DefaultParameterValues]
    HeadVoltage = 29.3 ;-- 29.3V for all heads in the system
    
    ;-- settings specific to individual heads on PCC1:HDC1
    [HeadDriver1:1]
    HeadVoltage = 28, 20 ;-- voltages for whole PCC1:HDC1:head1 and PCC1:HDC1:head2 respectively


    ;--- settings specific to individual nozzle rows on PCC1:HDC1:Head1
    [Head1:1:1]
    HeadVoltage = 25.1, 25.2, 25.3, 25.4 ;-- VRA, VRB, VRC, VRD for the head1 on PCC:1.HDC:1

-----  temperature control
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seiko RC1536 head has one thermistor and no built-in heater. Instead, external heater control can be used.
This external heater can be driven by 2 PWM signals on "heater" connector on HDC-2SII1536.
For this head heater control uses a single temperature from head thermistor and produces 2 identical PWM 
signals on a "heater" connector.

Seiko SG1024GS head has 2 thermistors (one per each head module or "half"). Our version of specs says that 
there are 2 built-in heaters, but the head we have doesn't seem to have it - it measureas as an open cicuit.
So, using external heater (similar "heater" connector on HDC-2SII1024) is an option.
For this head heater control uses individual signals from 2 head thermistors and produces 2 corresponding PWM 
signals for heaters.

For both heads the target head temperature is specified by CPEX_TargetTemp parameter that can be sev in the config file
or via SetParamEx() API.

This parametrs default value is 0, which means "no temperature control".
Max. target temperature is 50C for RC1536 and 55C for 1024GS.

This parameter along with other temperature-related ones  can be specified in following sections:
[DefaultParameterValues], [ControllerX], [HeadDriverX:Y]. This means that it is possible to specify temperature-related 
parameters down to individual heads only.

!! Important note: On the latest versions of HDC-2Sii1536 the connector and external heater control MOSFETs 
are not fitted, because no one seems to need them and the heads don't seem to have biult-in heaters.

    Getting real head temperatures/voltages
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The real (measured) values of temperatures and some other parameters are displayed in "Monitor" program, 
"Status" tab, HDC/Head status listbox.

User application can also obtain these values as a part of TAppHeadStatus structure via PiGetHeadStatus() or PiGetStatusEx() API.

Fields of TAppHeadStatus structure map to the real objects data as follows:

--- temperature is in degrees C multiplied by 10
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature1  - "HD1 Temp AB" (Head1, Module1)
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature2  - "HD1 Temp CD" (Head1, Module2)
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature3  - "HD2 Temp AB" (Head2, Module1)
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature4  - "HD2 Temp CD" (Head2, Module2)


--- voltages are scaled 10x times
TAppHeadStatus::Voltages[0] - "HD1 Drv Volts A"
TAppHeadStatus::Voltages[1] - "HD1 Drv Volts B"
TAppHeadStatus::Voltages[2] - "HD1 Drv Volts C"
TAppHeadStatus::Voltages[3] - "HD1 Drv Volts D"
                                             
                                             
TAppHeadStatus::Voltages[4] - "HD2 Drv Volts A"
TAppHeadStatus::Voltages[5] - "HD2 Drv Volts B"
TAppHeadStatus::Voltages[6] - "HD2 Drv Volts C"
TAppHeadStatus::Voltages[7] - "HD2 Drv Volts D"


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----- temperature/voltage compensation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This feature can be used to automatically adjust head voltages depending on the ink temperature. 
These heads have 4 voltages: VRA, VRB, VRC, VRD and they can be automaticaly adjusted as follows:

    VRes = VSet + (THeadC - TRefC)*TGragient 


    where
    
    VSet:       set voltages for VRA, VRB, VRC, VRD
    THeadC:     Head temperature in degrees C 
    TRefC:      head reference temperature, degrees C (25C by default)   
    TGragient:  A coefficient that defines temperature->voltage dependency. 
                Its value depends on ink type, but it seems that -0.134 V/DegC can be used as a reference value.

    VRes:  Adjusted head voltages

This mode is controlled by following parameters:

CPEX_RefTemp  - specifies TRefC, default value 25.0C
CPEX_Gradient - scpecifies TGragient, default value is 0 (no temperature compensation), should be in range [-1..1]

These parameters can be specified in following sections: [DefaultParameterValues], [ControllerX], [HeadDriverX:Y]. 

For example:

        [DefaultParameterValues]
        Gradients = -0.134        ; Head temperature/voltage compensation coefficient, V/DegC 
        HeadRefTemperature = 25.0 ; Reference temperature for temperature/voltage compensation

    Head voltages are set to 29.0V, 
    at 25C these voltages will be 29.0V, at 35C they will be 27.66V, at 22.7C they will be 29.3V
