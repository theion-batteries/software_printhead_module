    Some useful tips for debugging problems with XeroxW head
=================================================================================================



* Saving head NVRAM image to the file on a PC on head powering on: See "WF_Info.txt"    

* Exporting waveforms and WaveRam contents being sent to the head to a tabulated text file
    that can also be viewed with GNU Plot:  See "WF_Info.txt"    

* Monitoring some of the head status registers (RAM locations). It can be done in a Motnitor application,
    "Status" page->"HDC/head" pane. Update period is about 300ms.
        
        "Status Bits2" -> value from addr: 0x0000C -> latched fault/status head bits 
        "CtrlStat_0x2" -> value from addr: 0x00002 -> head control/status bits         
        
        "Head Temp"     current head temperature in degrees C.
        "Head TargetT"  target  head temperature in degrees C.

        "InkPressure1"  ink pressure in Pascals
        "InkPressure2"  ink pressure in Pascals


* It is also possible to dump some areas of head RAM into the file and transfer this file to the PC for study.
    Precondition: the head must be powered.
    This is done by sending a signal SIG_DEBUG_CONTROL to the selected PCC. Probably the simplest way to do this 
    is sending this signal from TestApp, as described here:  \TechnicalNotes\TestApp\Params_Signals.txt
    This signal code is 0x14 and signal data should be 0. 
    For example, if we want to ask for RAM dump of the head on PDC:1, then the "signal id" field should be: 00:01:01:14
    and "Val" field should be 0. See TestApp->"Scratch" tab -> "PiSetSignal API" box.
    Tip: look for errors in Monitor, if something goes wrong, the error will be displayed.
    If operation is successful, a file with the name "PCC1_XeroxW_RamDump.txt" will be created in the directory 
    where NVRAM images/Waveforms are stored ("PCC_DownloadedLogs" by default, see "WF_Info.txt").
    "PCCx" file name prefix corresponds to the PCC index we are dealing with.
    Note that this is quite expensive operation.


* Force sending WF data to HDC even in it is not powered or head is not present. This can be useful for WF debugging. 
    use "ForceHeadPowerON = 1" in [Test] section of the Meteor config file.
