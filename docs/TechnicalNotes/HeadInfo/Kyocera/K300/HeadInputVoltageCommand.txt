Some information regarding 0x19/0x59 "HeadInput voltage" command for Kj4-0300

=================================================================================================

For some strange reason K300 heads allow setting a parameter that specifies head input voltage.
It seems that not all heads support this feature. The older models don't seem to recognise such command.
Thus, this feature is made configurable. If there is no corresponding parameters in a connfig file, then 
this command won't be sent to the head.

In order to specify "Head input voltage", it is necessary to use "HeadVoltage" key either in [DefaultParameterValues] or 
in [ControllerX] section (or in both) like in the example below:


[DefaultParameterValues] 
HeadVoltage = 26.5; -- specifies HDC/head input voltage for WHOLE system, all PDCs


[Controller1] ; settings specific to each PDC

; must be 2 values that override value from [DefaultParameterValues] 
HeadVoltage = 29.5, 28 ; HDC/head input voltage for head1 and head2 on PDC1


"HeadVoltage" parameter values should be in [26.0, 30.0] volts range.



--- Debugging.
It is a good idea to allow logging Kyocera-specific serial commands for the first time to ensure that everything
works fine and 0x19/0x59 commans sent and processed OK.
It is done by enabling following logging categories:

[Test]
LogModules = "KyoceraSequencer|KyoceraSerial"

As the result, log should show following lines, and no error messages:

 Sending Read HeadInpVoltage command
 Sending Kyocera Head command 0xFEFEFE04190000E300000000
