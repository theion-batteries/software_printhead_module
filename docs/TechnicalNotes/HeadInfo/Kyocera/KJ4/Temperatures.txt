    Some information regarding temperature control for Kyocera KJ4 head driven by  PDC-2KA600
=================================================================================================


Hardware configuration:
    PDC-2KA600 drives two KJ4 heads. Default config file is: "DefaultKA600.cfg"


Notes on PCC/HDC/Head configuration:
    Basically, PDC-2KA600 is a usual PCC that drives two HDCs, each HDC drives one head. The only thing that
    PCC+HDCs are located on the same PCB. So, heads addressing looks as follows:

        Head1 on PDC3 ->  PCC:3, HDC:1, Head:1
        Head2 on PDC3 ->  PCC:3, HDC:2, Head:1            
    
    Note that head index is always 1 (HDC drives one head only), but HDC index specifies which "head" is
    being addressed.

--- setting up temperature control

There is config file parameter that can be used to set up temperature control:
    
    [KJ4]
    HeadTemperature = 35.0   ; target head temperature (C) !! This is a legacy parameter, see below.


--- Legacy (not recommended any longer) way of setting head target temperatures.
Previously the only setting was "HeadTemperature" in [KJ4] section. It was applied to the WHOLE system, 
addressing all PDCs/Heads. To set head target temperature on HDC basis, it was required to use PiSetParam() API and
CCP_HEAD_TEMP parameter. 
Using this parameters is not recommended, because there is a better way to achieve this:


--- Modern way of setting Head/Aux target temperatures.

There is now ConfigEngine parameter that allowa specifying individual heads' target temperatures:

KPEX_TargetTemp, id:CPEX_TargetTemp, valid range:[0.0..45.0], def:0.0, scope:[DefaultParameterValues], [ControllerX], [HeadDriverX:Y]


This parameter can be used down to HDC level, allowing setting target temperatures for individual HDCs/Heads. For example:

    [DefaultParameterValues]      ;-- global default values for the WHOLE system
    HeadTargetTemperature = 22.3  ;-- target head temperature for ALL heads in the ssytem


    [Controller1]  ;-- settings specific to the head on PCC:1, (override settings from [DefaultParameterValues])
    HeadTargetTemperature = 22.7, 25.4   ;-- head target temperatures for HDC:1(head1) and HDC:2(head2) on PDC:1


    [HeadDriver1:1] ;-- settings specific to the head on PCC:1, HDC:4 (override settings from Controller1)
    HeadTargetTemperature = 32.7  ;-- target head temperature for the head on PDC:1, HDC:1 (head1)

    [HeadDriver1:2] ;-- settings specific to the head on PCC:1, HDC:4 (override settings from Controller1)
    HeadTargetTemperature = 35.4  ;-- target head temperature for the head on PDC:1, HDC:2 (head2)



Using old "HeadTemperature" and new parameters in the config file is not recommended, this may lead to confusion.




------------------ Getting real heater temperatures

The real (measured) values of heater temperatures are displayed in "Monitor" program, "Status" tab, HDC/Head status listbox.
User application can also obtain these values as a part of TAppHeadStatus structure via PiGetHeadStatus() or PiGetStatusEx() API.

Fields of TAppHeadStatus structure map to the real objects data as follows:

--- Head temperature is in degrees C multipiled by 10
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature1    current measured head themperature
