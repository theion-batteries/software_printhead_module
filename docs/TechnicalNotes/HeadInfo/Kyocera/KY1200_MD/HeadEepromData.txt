    Getting static KY1200_MD head information
=================================================================================================

Static information, like head serial number etc. is published as EEPROM data
and can be obtainned in a form of JSON file via PiGetEepromData() API.

This information can also be obtained via TestApp. "Status" tab -> "Get Head EEPROM data" button.
Note that correct PCC/HDC numbers needs to be specified in the dropdown lists on the left.

 
an example of the JSON output from TestApp:
 

Head "EEPROM" contents

{
   "#HeadType" : "HT_KY1200_MD",
   "#InfoType" : "Head EEPROM Data",
   "00:00:00:00" : {
      "#DataValid" : true,
      "DriveNumber" : "920928924", // this is, basically, "Number of nozzles fires", read by 0x02 command
      "SerialNumber" : "20011701",
      "VAdj" : "0.0",
      "VDrv1_1" : "24.0",
      "VDrv1_2" : "24.0",
      "VDrv1_3" : "24.0",
      "VDrv1_4" : "24.0",
      "VDrv1_5" : "24.0",
      "VDrv2_1" : "24.0",
      "VDrv2_2" : "24.0",
      "VDrv2_3" : "24.0",
      "VDrv2_4" : "24.0",
      "VDrv2_5" : "24.0"
   }
}

Please note that any settings (voltages, waveforms etc.) changed in the head by user are PERSISTENT, i.e.
they are written into the head EEPROM and stay there.
So, it is a good idea in general to collect EEPROM data and save current waveform/delays into a file (see "WF_Info.txt")
before making any changes to head's settings.
