=================================================================================================
    Some information about "Tickle mapping" feature for KY1200RM  head type.
=================================================================================================

Details of this feature can be found in "Function of Fire Slot Conversion" Kyocera document.

Briefly, KY1200RM head can internally map any grey level value to another grey level value as a function of print
cycle number and some other parameters. 
For example, as the documentation shows, the head maps Fire0 (GL0, WF0) data to Fire11 (GL11, WF11) for every second
print cycle. I.e performs a sort of "tickling while printing". This feature is turned ON by default.

In Meteor terms it is called "Tickle Mapping" and this functionality is controlled by 2 parameters (two 32-bit values)
that are sent to the head on powering it on.

These (optional) parameters can be specified in Meteor config file as "TickleMapper1" and "TickleMapper2" keys, in 
sections: [DefaultParameterValues], [HeadDriverX].
If these parameters are not set, nothing is sent to Print Head and head uses its default values.

On head power ON these values are read from the head and sent to PrintEngne as "Head EEPROM data", and can be
obtained in a usual way. For example:

    {
    "#HeadType" : "HT_KY1200RM",
    "#InfoType" : "Head EEPROM Data",
    "00:00:00:00" : {
    "#DataValid" : true,

    "TickleMapper_1" : "0x000c01b0", <---- Mapping value 1
    "TickleMapper_2" : "0x00000000", <---- Mapping value 2
        
    "U1_Fire0" : "VRef:20.00v, VGain:1.0000"
    .....
    }  


"TickleMapper_1" value "0x000c01b0" means that Fire00 will be substituted with Fire11 for every second print cycle.
For the detailed explanation please refer to the original documentation.


In order to change these values and use some other FireX->FireY mapping it is necessary to specify 
TickleMapper_1 and/or TickleMapper_2  parameter values in a config file in a hex format.
 

--- Example of Meteor config file settings:

    [DefaultParameterValues]
    TickleMapper1 = 0x0c00B0 ;-- disable Fire0 to Fire11 mapping for the whole system
    ;TickleMapper2 = 0x00    ;-- commented out, won't be sent to the head.


    ;---Settings specific for PCC1:HDC1. Note that there is one head per HDC: 
    [HeadDriver1]
    TickleMapper1 = 0x0c01A0 ;-- enable Fire0 to Fire10 mapping for PDC1


If everything is OK, then on head power ON event log will contain something like this:

    "Setting TickleMapping value1 for[PCC:1,HDC:1]:0x000c00b0"

And head EEPROM data will reflect new mapping values.
