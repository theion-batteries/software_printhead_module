Getting static KY1200RM head information
=================================================================================================

Static information, like head serial number etc. is published as EEPROM data
and can be obtainned in a form of JSON file via PiGetEepromData() API.

This information can also be obtained via TestApp. "Status" tab -> "Get Head EEPROM data" button.
Note that correct PCC/HDC numbers needs to be specified in the dropdown lists on the left.

 
an example of the JSON output from TestApp:
 
{
  "#HeadType" : "HT_KY1200RM",
  "#InfoType" : "Head EEPROM Data",
  "01-01-01-01" : 
  {
    "#DataValid" : true,
    "HeadS/N" : "????????",
    "U1_Fire0" : "VRef:20.00v, VGain:1.0000",
    ...... skipped .....
    "U2_Fire9" : "VRef:0.00v, VGain:1.0000"
  }
}

Note that head S/N is not decoded, our head has this field filled with 0s.
Initial values of VRef/VGain for every head ASIC are reported here because they can be set at the 
factory as calibrated values and worth saving somewhere.
