    Some information regarding Kyocera KY0600_EX head voltages / temperatures  
=================================================================================================


Firsrt of all, on head power up all head original Voltages and some other settings are read and can be
retrieved by user application as a part of "Head EEPROM data", see "HeadEepromData.txt".
This is done because any values written to the head, like voltages, overwrite existing values in
head EEPROM and become permanent.
So, it might be a good idea to store original values somewhere before changing them.


=================================================================================================
--- Head voltages configuration:

In the simplest case no voltage parameters are specified in Meteor congig file at all.
In this case no voltage related data is sent to the head and it uses whatever is in its EEPROM.

There are several parameters that can be used for specifying head voltages.

------- "VoltageSetting" (head commands 0x15/0x95)

This parameter controls head driving voltage by sending command to the head to set up its internal voltage regulator.
This value is also read from the head on powering on and displayed in Monitor and as an EEPROM data item.

To specify this "VoltageSetting" following parameter is used, it can be set either in Meteor config file or
by using PiSetParamEx() API.

name:HeadVoltage,  id:KPEX_HeadVoltage, scope:[DefaultParameterValues], [ControllerX], [HeadDriverX:Y]


    "HeadVoltage" value can be:

        0.0v or "not set". In this case this particular voltage won't be sent to the head and thehead will use
                           the value which is written to its EEPROM.

        22.0..28.0 volts value


------- "HeadVoltageAdj" (head commands 0x34/0xB4)

This parameter specifies whole head driving voltage adjustment in the range [-3.2..+3.2] volts. Default value is 0.0V.

There is also a special value: 99 it is far outside the valid range and means "not set". If the value is "not set",
then PrintEngine will not sent any commands to the head to set "HeadVoltageAdj". 


name:HeadVoltageAdj,id:KPEX_HeadVoltageAdj, valid range:[-3.2..+3.2], def:0.0, scope:[DefaultParameterValues], [ControllerX], [HeadDriverX:Y]


------- Specifying Head voltage parameters in a config file:

Specifying "HeadVoltage" in [DefaultParameterValues] section sets them for the whole system, e.g:

    ;---Global system default settings:
    [DefaultParameterValues]
    HeadVoltage     = 23.3  ;-- value for ALL heads in the system
    HeadVoltageAdj  = 0.0   ;-- value for ALL heads in the system


Specifying parameter in [ControllerX] and/or in [HeadDriverX:Y] sections overrides values from [DefaultParameterValues]
and allows setting parameters for individual heads.

    [Controller1]   ;-- these values override ones from [DefaultParameterValues] section 
    HeadVoltage    = 23.8, 25.7  ;-- values for Head1 and 2 on PDC1 
    HeadVoltageAdj = 0.5,  -0.3  ;-- values for Head1 and 2 on PDC1 
    

    [HeadDriver1:1] ;-- these values override ones from [Controller1] section
    HeadVoltage     = 25.0  ;-- value for Head1 on PDC1
    HeadVoltageAdj = -1.2   ;-- value for Head1 on PDC1



=================================================================================================
--- Setting Head temperature.

    It can be set in the config file by "HeadTargetTemperature" key, which can be placed into [DefaultParameterValues], 
    [ControllerX], [HeadDriverX:Y] sections (see above).
    This parameter specifies head target temperature in degrees C. It should be in a range [15.0, 45.0]C, 
    and the default value is 0, which means: "use the value stored in the head EEPROM"



=================================================================================================
Getting real head voltages / temperatures
=================================================================================================
The real (measured) values of heads voltages, temperatures/ etc. are displayed in "Monitor" program, 
"Status" tab, HDC/Head status listbox.
There is a limted number of parameters that can be read from this type of head. 
The most useful ones are: 
    "heater seting value" or target temperature
    "Heater" temperature, the head real temperature.


User application can also obtain these values as a part of TAppHeadStatus structure via PiGetHeadStatus() or PiGetStatusEx() API.

Fields of TAppHeadStatus structure map to the real objects data as follows:
All voltages are 10x scaled; all temperatures are 10x scaled; Current is in mA.

    TAppHeadStatus::Temperature1 -> head target temperature.
    TAppHeadStatus::Temperature2 -> head current (measured) temperature.
    TAppHeadStatus::HeadVoltage  -> "HeadVoltage" voltage, 10x scaled

    -- this information is from PDC parameters measurements and common for both heads --
    TAppHeadStatus::Temperature3    ->  PSU1 Temperature, 10x scaled
    TAppHeadStatus::Temperature4    ->  PSU2 Temperature, 10x scaled
    TAppHeadStatus::AbsHeadVoltage  ->  Vin Voltage, 10x scaled
    TAppHeadStatus::Voltages[0]     ->  head1 VDrive, 10x scaled
    TAppHeadStatus::Voltages[1]     ->  head2 VDrive, 10x scaled
    TAppHeadStatus::Voltages[2]     ->  Head1 VDrive current, ma    
    TAppHeadStatus::Voltages[3]     ->  Head2 VDrive current, ma
