    Some information regarding selecting Kyocera KY0600_EX head sub-type
=================================================================================================

As far as we aware currently there are 2 major KY0600_EX head variants:

    * KJ4B-0600-020SP-***, 364 pixels wide. Meteor head sub-type: 0, default
    * KJ4B-0600-B24SP-***, 452 pixels wide. Meteor head sub-type: 1

These variants also have different nozzles layout.
Both of them are supported as HT_KY0600_EX head type, "KY0600_EX" name in the config file.
But in order to operate properly, a correct sub-type should be specified in Meteor config file.

sub-type:0 is the default one, if you use this particular head type, you don't need to additoinally specify it.

Otherwise, the following key is used: "HeadSubType". Its value should be 0 or 1, and it can be placed in the 
following sections: [DefaultParameterValues], [ControllerX], [HeadDriverX:Y].
Thus, it is possible to mix different sub-types on the same PDC. 	

    [DefaultParameterValues] 	
    ;HeadSubType = 0 ;-- head sub-type, global default value 

    [HeadDriver1:1]
    HeadSubType = 0,1 ;-- head sub-types for PDC1:Head1 and PDC1:Head2 accordingly
