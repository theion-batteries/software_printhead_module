    Getting static KY0600_EX head information
=================================================================================================

Static information, like head serial number etc. is published as EEPROM data
and can be obtainned in a form of JSON file via PiGetEepromData() API.

This information can also be obtained via TestApp. "Status" tab -> "Get Head EEPROM data" button.
Note that correct PCC/HDC numbers needs to be specified in the dropdown lists on the left.

 
an example of the JSON output from TestApp:
 
{
    "#HeadType" : "HT_KY0600_EX",
    "#InfoType" : "Head EEPROM Data",
    "00:00:00:00" : 
    {
       "#DataValid" : true,
       "DriveNumber" : "0",         // this is, basically, "Number of nozzles fires", read by 0x02 command 
       "DrivingStopFN" : "0",
       "SerialNumber" : "21052408", // head S/N
       "TLimits" : "34.1",
       "VAdj" : "-1.2",
       "VDefault" : "26.0",
       "VSetting" : "27.0"
    }
 }



Please note that any settings (voltages, waveforms etc.) changed in the head by user are PERSISTENT, i.e.
they are written into the head EEPROM and stay there.
So, it is a good idea in general to collect EEPROM data and save current waveform/delays into a file (see "WF_Info.txt")
before making any changes to head's settings.
