    Some information on setting up "PageSpit" feature for RG5 head
=================================================================================================

Note: This feature is available only for RG5 head, PCC-E and Cyclone4 HDC version.

Using this RG5-specific feature requires two parametess in a Meteor config file:

    PageSpitInterval = [0..255]   
    PageSpitPixel    = [0..7]

The interval parameter defines how many print lines between heach nozzle spit. One nozzle (selected by a pseudo-random
sequence) is fired each time. The pixel value defines the size of the drop.

Default value of these parameters is 0. If either of these parameters is 0, then "PageSpit" is turned off
These parameters can be specified downto HDC level, i.e. every HDC or head can have its own specific settings.
So that, parameters can be placed in [DefaultParameterValues], [ControllerX], [HeadDriverX:Y] sections
of the config file.

Note that for [ControllerX] section parameters must be represented as a list of 8 values, one per HDC.

You can additionally check Meteor log for the line that should look like: (you will need to enable "Setup" log category)

   "Write PageSpit [PCC:1,HDC:1] Reg:0x5c0, Value:0x8000040b"
