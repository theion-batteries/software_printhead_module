    Some information on using Ricoh Gen5/Gen5S/Gen6 heads
=================================================================================================

Meteor supports several modifications (or "sub-types") of Ricoh Gen5 heads:

    * Gen5      head (MH5420, MH5440)
    * Gen5S     head (MH5220)
    * GEN6      head (MH5320/MH5340)
    * GEN6_Fast head (MH5422/MH5442)

The most significant difference between these head sub-types from Meteor point of view is nozzle row positions within
the head. It is also possible to mix these sub-types within one PCC.


The old way of specifying head sub-type was using a number of parameters that provided nozzle rows positions 
(see below), and Meteor assumed that the rest of the Gen5/Gen5S/Gen6 properties is absolutely the same.
But updated specs from Ricoh now say that the max. temperature for Gen5/Gen6 heads is 60C and the max. temperature
for Gen5S variant is 50C. Also, Gen5S requires slower heating rate comparing to Gen5.

This has lead to the fact that it is now necessary to specify head sub-type explicitly in the Meteor Config file and 
some parameters, like nozzle rows separations, max. had tempearture and heater parameters will be set up 
depending on a concrete sub-type.

This partameter is:

    HeadSubType = 0     ; Head sub-type: 0 for Gen5 variant, 1 for Gen5S variant, 2 for Gen6, 3 for for Gen6_Fast . 

It can be placed in [DefaultParameterValues], [ControllerX], [HeadDriverX:Y] sections, witch allows mixing different
sub-types within one PCC.

If this parameter is missing, Meteor will log error message that looks like:

*** PrintEngine::Rg5Head::ProcessHeadSubTypes() Invalid or not specified head sub-type:255, using default

And it will fall back to default Gen5 variant.





------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- old way of selecting Gen5/Gen5S/Gen6 head sub-type by providing nozzle rows/ JA separations.
-- It is still possible to use these parameters, but tere is no real need for it now.


Meteor config file needs following parameters:
    *  NR_XSep_um - this is a distance between nozzle rows A-B or C-D in microns
    *  JA_XSep_um - this is a distance between "nead halves" or nozzle rows A-C or B-D in microns


If you are using the original Gen5 head, no settings required, Meteor will use default values.

Default config file "DefaultRicohGen5_PccE.cfg" already contains commented-out setting:


;-- These are the default values - correct for the standard Gen5 head (MH5420, MH5440)
;NR_XSep_um        = 550.3 ;-- distance between nozzle rows for one jetting assembly, microns
;JA_XSep_um        = 11811 ;-- distance between jetting assemblies, microns

;-- These values must be specified if using the small-drop GEN5S head (MH5220)
;NR_XSep_um        = 931.3 ;-- distance between nozzle rows for one jetting assembly, microns
;JA_XSep_um        = 9313  ;-- distance between jetting assemblies, microns

;-- These values must be specified if using the GEN6 head (MH5320/MH5340)
;NR_XSep_um        = 1100  ;-- distance between nozzle rows for one jetting assembly, microns
;JA_XSep_um        = 11811 ;-- distance between jetting assemblies, microns


They can be placed in [DefaultParameterValues] section (applies for the WHOLE system), or in [HeadDriverX:Y]
section. In the latter case these setting will override default ones from [DefaultParameterValues], allowing
individual diffrerent head sub-types for different HDCs.
