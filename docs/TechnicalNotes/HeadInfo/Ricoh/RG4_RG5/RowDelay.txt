    Some information on setting "Row Delay" for RG5 head
=================================================================================================

Note: This feature is available only for RG5 head, PCC-E and Cyclone4 HDC version.

RG5 HDC drives one head that has 4 nozzle rows or JAs. "Row Dealay" feature allows setting individual delays
for every JA. This delay can be in range [0..100] microseconds. Default value is 0us.

CPEX_RowDelay parameter is used for this and it can be set either in Meteor config file or via SetParamEx() API.
Row delays are applied on StartJob.


--- Meteor config file set up.
In order to set row delays, it is necessary to specify "RowDelay_us" parameter in the config file. 
It can be placed in following sections: [DefaultParameterValues], [ControllerX], [HeadDriverX:Y] and [HeadX:Y] sections.

As soon as the most common use case is assigning different row delays for individual JAs, this parameter is the most 
likely to be used in [HeadX:Y] section. For this section parameter value is represened by a list of 4 values, each 
one is a "row delay" in microseconds for head nozzle rows.

For example:

[Head1:4]
RowDelay_us = 11,12,13,14; ;-- values for JA0, JA1, JA2, JA3 respectively


You can additionally check Meteor log for the line that should look like: (you will need to enable "Setup" log category)

   "Write RowDelay PCC:1, HDC:4  Reg:0x443, Value:0x0e0d0c0b"
