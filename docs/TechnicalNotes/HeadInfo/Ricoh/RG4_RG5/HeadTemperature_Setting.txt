    Some information on setting head temperature for RG4/RG5 heads
=================================================================================================

There are several ways of specifying/setting head target tempeartures:
    * Legacy way (applies to HT_RG4 and HT_RG5 head types)
    * "New" way, it applies to HT_RG5 head type only


---
Important: HT_RG5 head type has several sub-types (see "Gen5_Gen5S_Gen6.txt")
Previously there was no difference between them from tempearture control point of view.
But recent specs update from Ricoh specified max. head temperature 60C for Gen5, Gen6 sub-types and 50C for Gen5S.
Also, Gen5S heating up speed is limited according to new specs.
This means that target temperature 55C is valid for Gen5, but if this value is set for Gen5S variant, Meteor 
will log an error and will limit max. temperature to 50C.

A bit more technical information abour Gen5S temperature control:
    * max temperature is 50C
    * heat up rate is 0.1C/sec  for the temperature range [15..45C]    
    * heat up rate is 0.05C/sec for the temperature range [46..50C]
    So, heating the head from 20C to 45C will take about 250 seconds (4..5 minutes). 
    For standard 24V heater supply max. Gen5S heater power is limited to about 7..8 Watts by firmware in HDC controller.
    
 


------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Legacy way of specifying head target temperatures:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The simplest way to set head target temperature for RG4/RG5 heads is to specify it 
in the config file, [Head] section like:

[RicohGen5]
HeadTemperature  = 30.0   ; Target head temperature in degC (0.0 = disabled)

This settings is applied to ALL heads in the system and is "global default" value.


It is possible, but not very straightforward  to set target head temperature to any head individually using 
CCP_HEAD_TEMP parameter.

CCP_HEAD_TEMP addressing: It accepts following arguments to select PCC/HDC/Head:
     * PccNum - PCC Number  [1..254]  
     * HdcNum - HDC Number  [1..8]
     * "aNum" - meaning depends on RG4 or RG5 head
    
    There are special values for these parameters. 
        - If both PccNum and HdcNum are 0, then all heads in the system will be addressed

CCP_HEAD_TEMP command value:
    
     * if it is 0, then the heads addressed will receive target temperature from "global default" value (see config file).
     * otherwise target temperature multiplied by 10 (e.g 438 corresponds to 43.8 degreesC)

--- 
HDC-R5: 

It drives drives 1 head, so "aNum" parameter from CCP_HEAD_TEMP command is ignored.
Also, there is no check that target temperature exceeds some maximum.

--- 
HDC-R4: 

It drive 2 heads, each head has 2 JAs. 
    
    if "aNum"  parameter is 0, then all heads will be assigned given target temperature.

    if "aNum"  parameter is 1 or 2, then Head1 will be assigned given target temperature.
    if "aNum"  parameter is 3 or 4, then Head2 will be assigned given target temperature.



------------------------------------------------------------------------
    New way of specifying head target temperatures (for HT_RG5 only)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

HT_RG5 head type now supports a "new" way of setting head target temperature in a config file.

It can use "HeadTargetTemperature" parameter in [DefaultParameterValues], [ControllerX] [HeadDriverX:Y] sections.
"Old" parameter:"HeadTemperature " from [RicohGen5] section is still supported, but it is not recommended
to mix old and new parameters.

For example:
    [DefaultParameterValues]
    HeadTargetTemperature = 32.2 ;-- default target temperature for the whole system

    [HeadDriver1:1] 
    HeadTargetTemperature = 43.8 ;-- target temperature for the head on PCC:1. HDC:1

    [HeadDriver1:2]
    HeadTargetTemperature = 53.2 ;-- target temperature for the head on PCC:1. HDC:2






-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Getting real head /HDC temperatures
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The real (measured) values of temperatures and some other parameters are displayed in "Monitor" program, 
"Status" tab, HDC/Head status listbox.

User application can also obtain these values as a part of TAppHeadStatus structure via PiGetHeadStatus() or PiGetStatusEx() API.

Fields of TAppHeadStatus structure map to the real objects data as follows:

--- temperature is in degrees C multiplied by 10

--- For both RG4 and RG5 HDC boards:
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature5  - HDC amplifier1 temperature
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature6  - HDC amplifier2 temperature
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature7  - HDC amplifier3 temperature  
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature8  - HDC amplifier4 temperature


--- 2 RG4 Head temperatures:
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature1  -  Head1 "Odd  row" temperature-+-- this should be identical
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature2  -  Head1 "Even row" temperature-'
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature3  -  Head2 "Odd  row" temperature-¬
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature4  -  Head2 "Even row" temperature-+-- this should be identical


--- RG5 Head temperature:
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature1  -  Head temperature
