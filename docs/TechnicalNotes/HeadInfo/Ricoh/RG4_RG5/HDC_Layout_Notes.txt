    Some notes regarding HDC-RG4/RG5 head specific features
------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------------------------------------------
HDC-RG5 drives one head that has 4 nozzle rows (or JAs). In Ricoh documentation
they referred as rows 1(A), 2(B), 3(C), 4(D)

simplified HDC-RG5 layout looks as follows:  

    * this is a view THROUGH the head to the media 
    * heads orientation is 0

HDC-RG4 drives two heads that, each head has 2 nozzle rows (or JAs). In Ricoh documentation
they referred as "odd" (1), and "even"(2)

simplified HDC-RG4 layout looks as follows:  

    * this is a view THROUGH the head to the media 
    * heads orientation is 0

!!! Notes: despite HDC-RG4 driving explicitly 2 heads, PE-Addressing (at least for Waveforms) uses Head:0 and JA0..3 !
!!! This is becasue this functionality had been retrofitted on top of the existing code that was the same for RG4/RG5
