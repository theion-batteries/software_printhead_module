    Some information regarding  Epson S3200 head voltages / temperatures  
=================================================================================================

The real (measured) values of heads voltages, temperatures/ etc. are displayed in "Monitor" program, 
"Status" tab, HDC/Head status listbox.


User application can also obtain these values as a part of TAppHeadStatus structure via PiGetHeadStatus() or PiGetStatusEx() API.

Fields of TAppHeadStatus structure map to the real objects data as follows:
All voltages are 10x scaled; all temperatures are 10x scaled; Current is in mA.

    TAppHeadStatus::Voltages[0]  -> HDC supply current, ma
    TAppHeadStatus::Voltages[1]  -> VHV voltage,  10x scaled
    TAppHeadStatus::Voltages[2]  -> VBS voltage,  10x scaled
    TAppHeadStatus::Voltages[3]  -> VH voltage,   10x scaled


    TAppHeadStatus::Temperature1 -> head temperature.

    TAppHeadStatus::Temperature2 -> high 16 bits: B1 amplifier, low 16 bits: A1 amplifier temperatures
    TAppHeadStatus::Temperature3 -> high 16 bits: B2 amplifier, low 16 bits: A2 amplifier temperatures
    TAppHeadStatus::Temperature4 -> high 16 bits: B3 amplifier, low 16 bits: A3 amplifier temperatures
    TAppHeadStatus::Temperature5 -> high 16 bits: B4 amplifier, low 16 bits: A4 amplifier temperatures

--------- Notes on the so-called "Head voltages" on the head label and from head EEPROM 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The label on the head and head EEPROM, see "HeadEepromData.txt" has some number of codes that describe a 
number of voltage values: "VhKLRT_ChipX, VhKSRT_ChipX".
There are some points to take into account:

    * This type of head doesn't have "head driving voltage" as such. It uses trapesoidal analogue waveform
      with several pulses (see "WF_Info.txt", "WaveformsScaling.txt").

    * Head specs have some quite specific waveform examples, and those "VhKLRT", "VhKSRT" values define 
      amplitude of certain pulse in those waveform from the specs.

    * Customers are free to develop their own waveforms, which can be quite different from examples in head
      specs. Waveform shape/number of pulses depends on many factors, like number of grey levels, printing speed,
      ink type and so on.

Thus, all these "VhKLRT_ChipX, VhKSRT_ChipX" voltages do not look very useful. Though those values may be used
to calculate waveform scaling factors between head ASICs (see "WaveformsScaling.txt"). No idea how useful it might be.
