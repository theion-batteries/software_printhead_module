    Some information regarding ASICs ("chips"/print modules) stitching for Epson S3200 head
=================================================================================================


Epson S3200 head consists of 4 print modules ("chips") in Epson terminology.
They will be referred as "ASICs" here. So, "chip1" corresponds to "ASIC1" and so on.
Each ASIC drives 800 nozzles and these ASICs have overlapping region of 120 nozzles between them.

So, overlapping ASICs are: [ASIC1, ASIC2], [ASIC2, ASIC3], [ASIC3, ASIC4]. Thus, there are 3 
overlapping regions, 120 nozzles each.


Here is the picture showing ASIC1 and ASIC2 overlapping: 
The same applies for [ASIC2, ASIC3], [ASIC3, ASIC4] pairs.


                      ASIC1

                      | O |      swath Nz 1
                      | . |

Neither print head itself, nor Meteor hardware cares about ASIC stitching, so, if we just sent print data to all 
ASICs, pixels in overlapping regions will be printed twice, which, probably, is not a very good idea.
To deal with that problem PrintEngine applies "stitching masks" for the ASIC overlapping regions. 
In the simplest default case the algorithm is: "every even nozzle in the overlapping region belongs to one ASIC, 
every odd nozzle - to another." So, for the picture above ASC1&2 stitching region will be printed like:

     O
     X      Where:   'O'  - nozzles that belong to ASIC1 
     O               'X'  - nozzles that belong to ASIC2 
     X
     O
     X
     .
     .
     X


This should be enough for the most of the cases, it is set up by default and works straight from the box.

On the other hand, if some nozzles in ASIC stitching region becomes blocked, and this nozzle is selected
to print, then the pixels along the swath won't be printed at all. In this case it is possible to change the 
stitching mask to disable this particular nozzle in one ASIC and enable in another ASIC that is stitched with 
the first one.

This can be done by using EpsonS-series specific "ASIC stitching file" that describes which nozzles for 
which ASICs in the stitching region will print or not.
Setting up this file is very similar to a standard waveform file:

    * it is possible to specify upto 100 such files in the config file, e.g:
             [EPSON_S3200]
             AsicStitchFile1 = "Waveform\Epson\S3200\TestS3200_AsicStitch.txt"
             AsicStitchFile2 = "Waveform\Epson\S3200\SomeOther_AsicStitch.txt"

    * Then parameter "AsicStitchFileIdx" selects this "stitch file" index for desired set of System/PCC/HDC
      it can be places in sections: [DefaultParameterValues], [ControllerX], [HeadDriverX:Y]
      By default value of this parameter is 0, which means "use default hardcoded stitching pattern".
  
    * there is an example of such file: "Waveform\Epson\S3200\TestS3200_AsicStitch.txt" 
      It contains all default values.


--- ASIC stitching file format:

For ES3200 head it must contain 3 sections: [StitchMask_ASIC12],[StitchMask_ASIC23],[StitchMask_ASIC34], which
define data for the stitching regions: [ASIC1, ASIC2], [ASIC2, ASIC3], [ASIC3, ASIC4] accordingly.
 
Every section must contain 2 keys: "TopAsicMask" and "BotAsicMask" that correspond to "Top" and "Bottom" ASICs 
withn the stitching region.
Key value is a string of 8-bit hex numbers. These dumps must contain 15 bytes, which is  120 bits for 120 nozzles 
in the rerion where "top" and "bottom" ASICs overlap.
So, the key value defines a 120-bit vector. For the bits set to '1' in this vector coresponding nozzle in the
corresponding ASIC will print data; for '0' bit it will not print. 

The leftmost bit in this vector corresponds to the top nozzle in the stitching band (or topmost nozzle of the 
stitched "bottom" ASIC).

For example, default values:

    [StitchMask_ASIC12]
    TopAsicMask = 0x55,0x55,0x55,0x55,0x55,0x55,0x55,0x55,0x55,0x55,0x55,0x55,0x55,0x55,0x55
    BotAsicMask = 0xaa,0xaa,0xaa,0xaa,0xaa,0xaa,0xaa,0xaa,0xaa,0xaa,0xaa,0xaa,0xaa,0xaa,0xaa

will result in:

    ASIC1 Mask = 010101......01
    ASIC2 Mask = 101010......10

which in turn is the same as the default hardcoded pattern.

Note that all 4 combinations of Top/Bottom ASIC bits in bitmasks are valid:


                        bit values in "TopAsicMask" and "BotAsicMask"
                        _____________________________________________
                       |               |              |              |
                       v               v              v              v
    Top ASIC nozzle:   0 <-no print,   0 <-no print,  1<-prints,     1<-prints
 Bottom ASIC nozzle:   0 <-no print,   1 <-prints,    0<-no print,   1<-prints


So, it is possible to use "overprint", when stitched pixel is printed twice, by top and bottom ASICs' nozzle.

For example, these masks will cause every pixel in stitch band between ASIC1&ASIC2 be printed twice:

    [StitchMask_ASIC12]
    TopAsicMask = 0xFF,0xFF,.....0xFF
    BotAsicMask = 0xFF,0xFF,.....0xFF





--- Notes:

    - it is possible to use SimPrint to see how ASIC stitching masks are applied. For Epson S series heads
      there is "Show Epson ASICs" checkbox that allows displaying ASICs within the head with different colour.
    
    - !Important: This head is very wide in X-direction, about 360 pixels. And the slightest head misalignments,
      especilally Yaw (head leading edge is not ideally perpendicular to the head/media motion) can lead
      to the problems with pixels being out of order in Y-direction. This can be very well visible on diagonal 
      lines in ASIC stitching regions
