Some information on the waveform files for Epson S800 head family head
=================================================================================================

Basically, all waveform information for S800 head is absolutely the same as for S3200, because 
they use the same ASICs. The only difference is that S3200 has 4 ASICs (JAs in Meteor terminology) and 
S800 uses just one ASIC. So, please refer to S3200 documentation.



=================================================================================================
     Hardware configuration:
=================================================================================================
    
    * HDC-ES3200 drives one ES800  head        
    * ES800 head has 1 "chip" or "ASIC". It is referred as Jetting Assemblies (JAs) by Meteor.
    * ASIC drives 2 nozzle rows: rowA and rowB (nozzle rows are not related to ComA/ComB waveforms)
    * Within an ASIC both its nozzle rows: RowA and RowB share the same waveform, but these nozzle rows can have
      different GreyLevel masks (see below).


    * it is possible to specify an optional "tickling waveform" that applies to the head the same way
      as normal working one, but only when there is no encoder pulses (head is idle). 
      In order to achieve this a parameter "TickleWaveformFileIdx" can be specified. Its default value 
      is 0, which means "tickling is disabled". It it has a value of a correct waveform file index, then 
      corresponding waveform will be used as tickling one.



    Configuration example:

    [EPSON_S800] ;-- "head" section
    Waveform1 = "Waveform\Epson\S800\TestS800_Waveform.ComA"  ; working waveform file1 
    Waveform2 = "Waveform\Epson\S800\TestS800_Waveform2.ComA" ; working waveform file2  
    Waveform3 = "Waveform\Epson\S800\S800Tickle_Waveform.ComA"; tickling WF


    ;--- Global system default settings
    [DefaultParameterValues]
    WaveformFileIdx       = 1 ; Global default value
    TickleWaveformFileIdx = 0 ; Don't use tickling waveforms


    [Controller1]             ;--- PCC level (overrides settings in [DefaultParameterValues] section)
    WaveformFileIdx       = 1 ; All heads on PCC:1 will use working waveforms:  "TestS800_Waveform"
    TickleWaveformFileIdx = 3 ; All heads on PCC:1 will use tickling waveforms: "S800Tickle_Waveform"
