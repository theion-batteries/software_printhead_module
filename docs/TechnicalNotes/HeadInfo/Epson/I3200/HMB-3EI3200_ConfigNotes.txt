    Some information about EpsonI3200 head configuration driven by HMB-3EI3200
=================================================================================================



-- Hardware configuration:
    HMB-3EI3200 drives three EpsonI3200 heads. Default Meteor config file is: "DefaultEpsonI3200_PccZ.cfg"


-- Notes on PCC/HDC/Head configuration:
    Basically, HMB-3EI3200 is a usual PCC that drives 3 HDCs, each HDC drives one head. The only thing that
    PCC+HDCs are located on the same PCB. So, heads addressing looks as follows:

        Head1 on HMB5 ->  PCC:5, HDC:1, Head:1
        Head2 on HMB5 ->  PCC:5, HDC:2, Head:1            
        Head3 on HMB5 ->  PCC:5, HDC:3, Head:1            
    
    Note that head index is always 1 (HDC drives one head only), but HDC index specifies which "head" is
    being addressed.


-- Colour planes

EpsonI3200 is made of 4 "Chips" in Epson terminology or ASICs. Each ASIC has 2 nozzle rows 400 nozzles each, 800
nozzles per whole ASIC. Thus, total number of nozzes per whole head is 4*800.

But the head print swath is still 800 nozzles, because all ASICs are located in parallel in X-direction and nozzles
from different colour planes print at the same Y-position, on top of each other.

The head by design has 4 ink ports.  Meteor system must be configured as 4 colour planes per head.
Any other configuration will produce an error and won't print correctly.
