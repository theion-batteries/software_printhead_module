    Some information on Epson I3200 head family types / sub-types
=================================================================================================


--- standard I3200_A1 variant

It is 600 DPI 4 colour variant. In Meteor terms it is referred as "EPSON_I3200" in a config file, which 
corresponds to HT_EPSON_I3200. config file: "DefaultEpsonI3200_PccZ.cfg"
It has 3200 nozzles in total, 4 colour planes 800 nozzles each, whole swath is 800 pixels.
Pixels in all 4 colour planes print precisely on top of each other.


--- I3200_A1HD  2 colour head
It has 1200 DPI and the whole head swath is 1600 nozzles.
This head has 2 sub-types depending on how the ink supply is connected to the nozzle rows.

Because of the different DPI, we had to introduce a different head type for it.
In Meteor terms it is referred as "EPSON_I3200_HD" in a config file, which 
corresponds to HT_EPSON_I3200_HD. config file: "DefaultEpsonI3200_HD_PccZ.cfg"

The colour planes configuration in the Meteor config file should be set to 2 planes, e.g:

    [Planes]
    PlanesPerHdc = 2
    Plane1              = 1:1:1 ; Head mapped to plane 1 (PccNum:HdcNum:ClrNum)
    Plane2              = 1:1:2 ; Head mapped to plane 2 (PccNum:HdcNum:ClrNum)

See also default config file for more details.
These head type has the same general structure as HT_EPSON_I3200 (4 ASICs, 2 nozzle rows per ASIC), but 
ASIC[0,1] and ASIC[2,3] interlace in Y-direction, giving 1200 DPI total resolution.
Interlacing ASICs/nozzle rows now result in fact that some pixels from different colour planes now can't print
on top of each other. It can be easily seen in head nozzles layout from the specs.

-- 8 colour variant:
    It's possible to split the head into 8 nozzle rows by using PlanesPerHdc = 8
    Individual nozzle rows have 300 DPI and 400 nozzles.
    The rows can then be interlaced into a 2 colour head using Yinterlace = 4. Which rows interlace with which is then user defined,
    based on which plane the rows are placed in.
    For example:
    Plane1 = 1:1:1,1:1:2,1:1:3,1:1:4
    Plane2 = 1:1:5,1:1:6,1:1:7,1:1:8
    will combine ASIC0 and ASIC1 into a 4 row head for plane 1, and combine ASIC2 and ASIC3 into a 4 row head for plane 2.

    Rows have to be combined according to their physical offsets in the head, which are rows [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] = offsets [0,2,1,3,0,2,1,3].
    You need to end up with each head having 1 row each at 0,1,2,3.

    Yinterlace = 2 can be used to create a 4 colour head in a similar fashion, though the head being used will be limited by the physical offsets in the nozzle rows.
