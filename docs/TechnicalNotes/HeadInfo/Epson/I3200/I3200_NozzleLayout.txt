    Some information on nozzle layout for the Epson I3200-A1 head
=================================================================================================

This document shows head nozzle layout from our HDC point of view.
Epson's specs are very confusing and contradict to each other.

Important! The picture below is a view THROUGH the head on to the paper.



            ASIC3        ASIC2        ASIC1        ASIC0   <- ASIC number (Chip4..1 in Epson terminology)

            A  B         A  B         B  A         B  A    <- Our ASIC nozzle row notation

           C1  C2       C3  C4       C4  C3       C2  C1   <- Head colour index (the way ink is plumbed in the head)
           |   |        |   |         |  |         |  |
           |   |        |   `---------'  |         |  |
           |   |        `----------------'         |  |
           |   `-----------------------------------'  |
           `------------------------------------------'




Ink ports to colour planes mapping.

There are 4 ink ports in this head [Port1..Port4]. If we mount the head at Orientation 0, and look THROUGH 
the head on to the paper, then ink Port1 will be on the left, and it is the _closest_ to the head edge. 
So, ink ports numbers 1..4 will be arranged from the left to right.

    ink Port1   -> rows A,H -> C1 -> Meteor colour Plane1   *:1:1
    ink Port2   -> rows B,G -> C2 -> Meteor colour Plane2   *:1:2
    ink Port3   -> rows C,F -> C3 -> Meteor colour Plane3   *:1:3
    ink Port4   -> rows D,E -> C4 -> Meteor colour Plane4   *:1:4

If your ink ports do not have this mapping, or you are not printing with 4 colours, then you should use the I3200_HD head typ.
It gives finer control for printing specific nozzle rows to specific colour planes.
