    Some information about EpsonI1600 head configuration driven by HMB-3EI3200
=================================================================================================



-- Hardware configuration:
    HMB-3EI3200 with some hardware modifications drives three EpsonI1600 heads. Default Meteor config file is: "DefaultEpsonI1600_PccZ.cfg"
    ! Important ! never attach I1600 head to the standard non-modified version of HMB-3EI3200. This will dabage the head and HMB


-- Notes on PCC/HDC/Head configuration:
    Basically, HMB-3EI3200 is a usual PCC that drives 3 HDCs, each HDC drives one head. The only thing that
    PCC+HDCs are located on the same PCB. So, heads addressing looks as follows:

        Head1 on HMB5 ->  PCC:5, HDC:1, Head:1
        Head2 on HMB5 ->  PCC:5, HDC:2, Head:1            
        Head3 on HMB5 ->  PCC:5, HDC:3, Head:1            
    
    Note that head index is always 1 (HDC drives one head only), but HDC index specifies which "head" is
    being addressed.

See "I1600_NozzleLayout.txt" for more information


-- Waveforms:
Epson I3200 and I1600 use the same ASICs, so, the waveform files are completely compatible for those head types.
Though you can explicitly set a correct head type in the WF file (see WF examples).

-- EEPROM
It looks like I3200 head EEPROM contains exactly the same information as I3200. Please refer to I3200 documentation.
