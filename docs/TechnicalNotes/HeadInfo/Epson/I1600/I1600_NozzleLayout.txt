    Some information on nozzle layout for the Epson I1600 head
=================================================================================================

This document shows head nozzle layout from our HDC point of view.

The head has 4 nozzle rows, every nozzle row belongs to its own colour plane.
Y-resolution of every row is 300DPI and it has 400 nozzles. 
2 rows in every ASIC are interlaced in Y-direction, which gives 800 pixels in a head swath.

Important! The picture below if a view THROGH the head on to the paper.

            F  E         D  C      <- original HMB-I3200 nozzle rows (the head is driven by modified HMB-I3200 and the same FPGA)
