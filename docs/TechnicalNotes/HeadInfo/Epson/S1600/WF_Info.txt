Some information on the waveform files for Epson S1600 head family head
=================================================================================================

Basically, all waveform information for S1600 head is absolutely the same as for S3200, because 
they use the same ASICs. The only difference is that S3200 has 4 ASICs (JAs in Meteor terminology) and 
S1600 has 2 ASICs. So, please refer to S3200 documentation.
