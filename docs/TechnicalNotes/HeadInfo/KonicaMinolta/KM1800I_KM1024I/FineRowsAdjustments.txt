Some information on "fine row adjustment" for KM1800i/1024i print heads 

=================================================================================================

This topic periodically appears in customers' questions, so it is better to document it.


KM1800i/1024i heads are made of 2 "halves" or "PrintModules" or "Jettting assemblies" (JAs) in Meteor terms.
Every head "half" is made of several nozzle rows: 

    KM1024i:  Half1:[LA+LB]     Half2:[RA+RB]
    KM1800i:  Half1:[LA+LB+LC]  Half2:[RA+RB+RC]

The problem is that within one JA or "head half" nozzle rows (e.g. [LA+LB]) share the same firing signal, i.e. they 
fired at the same time.
But each head "half" has its own fire signal.

This means that it is possible to apply fine row adjustments (by delaying fire siggal with 1/16 pixel clock resolution)
to head halves or JAs, but it is not possible to fine adjust nozzle rows x-positions withing one JA.
