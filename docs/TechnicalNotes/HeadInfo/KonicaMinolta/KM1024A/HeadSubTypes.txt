    Some information regarding different variants of Konica Minolta KM1024A family heads
=================================================================================================

There are several variants of KM1024A head ("sub-types" in Meteor terminology). They have slightly different
physical properties and therefore Meteor system needs to know about it.

There is a parameter in a config file that can specify which sub-type is used:

---
name:HeadSubType, id:CPEX_HeadSubType, valid range:[0,1], def:0, scope:[DefaultParameterValues], [ControllerX], [HeadDriverX:Y]

This parameter allows selection of "Head sub-type". Allowed values:
        * 0 (default) selects KM1024A-LHG variant
        * 1 selects  KM1024A-SHE  variant, which has different nozzle rows positions.
        * 2 selects  KM1024A-SHE-HR variant that has different thermal properties


This parameter can be specified  in [DefaultParameterValues], which affects whole system, and in
[ControllerX], [HeadDriverX:Y] sections. In the later case it is possible to configure HDCs on PCC:X drive different head sub-types.

E.g. following example:
        [Controller1]
        HeadSubType =  1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0 

Will make PrintEngine use SHE variant on PCC1:HDC1 and PCC1:HDC2, while all other HDCs on PCC1 will use LHG variants.

This example specifies SHE variant on PCC1:HDC1 only.

        [HeadDriver1:1]
        HeadSubType = 1     ; 0(default) for LHG variant, and 1 for SHE variant



--- brief KM1024A sub-types description:

sub-type 0: KM1024A-LHG
    Nozzle rows positions:[0,12,36,48] pixels at native 360 DPI.
    Max. operating temperature 55C


sub-type 1: KM1024A-SHE
    Nozzle rows positions:[0,12,28,40] pixels at native 360 DPI.
    Max. operating temperature 55C
    
sub-type 2: KM1024A-SHE-HR "High temperature" variant of KM1024A-SHE.
    Nozzle rows positions:[0,12,28,40] pixels at native 360 DPI.
    Max. operating temperature 83C. Also has different head thermistor value.


=================================================================================================
!! Important !!

Proper support for the KM1024A-SHE-HR "High temperature" varian is implemented only on HDC RevC and later.
Before that the HDC would have to be modified to correctly support "High temperature" head variant.
The problem is "High temperature" head variant has 100K thermistor instead 10K for the other head sub-types.
So, if you are trying to use KM1024A-SHE-HR and see weird head temperature, then you need to check if 
you are using modified pre-RevC HDC or HDC RevC and later and the hea sub-type is set correctly.

And vice versa, using modified pre-RevC HDC and connecting "low temperature" head to it will result in weird 
head temperature readings.
