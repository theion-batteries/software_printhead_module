    Some information regarding Samba HDC/PDS differences
=================================================================================================

--- PCC+HDC configuration.

    PCC-E drives upto 8 HDC-SB boards. Each HDC-SB board drives one head. Ecah head has 2 "halves" or JAs in
    Meteor terminology.

    PE-addressing [PCC, HDC, Head, JA] for this scenario looks as follows: 

        [PCC, HDC, 1, 1]    Head1, JA1 on a specific PCC/HDC
        [PCC, HDC, 1, 2]    Head1, JA2 on a specific PCC/HDC

    Note that 'Head' index is always 1, because there is only one head per HDC    



--- PCC-Z + HMB-2SB => PDS-2SBZ configuration.

    PCC-Z plugs into HMB-2SB board and they both make PDS-2SBZ unit that drives 2 heads. 
    From Meteor system point of view  HMB-2SB is just 2 "HDCs" on the same PCB, each HDC still drives one Samba head.
    So, in theory, this configuration is not different from the case of PCC-E driving only 2 HDC-SB boards.   

    PE-addressing [PCC, HDC, Head, JA] for this scenario looks as follows: 

        [PCC, 1, 1, 1]    Head1, JA1 on a specific PCC, "HDC1"
        [PCC, 1, 1, 2]    Head1, JA2 on a specific PCC, "HDC1"

        [PCC, 2, 1, 1]    Head1, JA1 on a specific PCC, "HDC2"
        [PCC, 2, 1, 2]    Head1, JA2 on a specific PCC, "HDC2"

    Note that 'Head' index is always 1, because there is only one head per built-in "HDC" on HMB-2SB.
    Built-in "HDC"  index is either 1 or 2.
