    Some information about fine row adjustments for DimatixSamba head
=================================================================================================

Samba head has 2 modules or "Jetting assembiles" (JAs): "Side A" and "Side B" according to head datasheet.
Nozzle positions within one module are fixed. But 2 JAs withing the head have independent fire signals, so,
it is possible to adjust JAs' positions independently of each other.


--- internal mapping:
    index         PEAddr      head module  TOR Nibble
    HDC row0 -> [xx:xx:00:00]  Side A         0
    HDC row1 -> [xx:xx:00:01]  Side B         1
 
In brief: JA0 corresponds to "Side A",  JA1 corresponds to "Side B".

Parameters CPEX_RowX_Adj_um and CPEX_RowX_Adj_cpix can be used to specify fine "row" or JA adjusments within the head.
(See ConfigParameters.txt and example in DefaultSamba_PccE.cfg as well).

In a Meteor config file these parameters named as "Row_X_Adj_um" and "Row_X_Adj_cpix". 
Fine JA adjustments can be applied for each side of the head using microns or centipixels (1/100 of a pixel), but not 
both. If both "Row_X_Adj_um" and "Row_X_Adj_cpix" parameters found, their values ignored and an error message is logged.
Adjustment values can be both positive and negative. 

These parameters are usually placed in [HeadX:Y] section. 
In this case the value list must contain 2 values, each specifies an adjustment for a particular head module (A and B).
In scanning mode these adjustments apply to BOTH forward and reverse passes.  

Also in scanning mode following parameters can be applied:

Forward scan:  FwdScan_X_Adj_cpix, FwdScan_X_Adj_um
Reverse scan:  RevScan_X_Adj_um, RevScan_X_Adj_cpix

These parameters work the same way as Row_X_Adj_um" and "Row_X_Adj_cpix.
