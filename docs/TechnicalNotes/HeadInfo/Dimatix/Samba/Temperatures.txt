    Some information regarding  Samba head/amplifiers  temperatures  
=================================================================================================


-- System configuration:

A PCC drives upto 8 HDCs. Each HDC drives one Samba head. Each Samba head has to "halves", 
each head "half" is driven by its own amplifier, so, 2 amplifiers per head.
        


The real (measured) values of head / amplifiers temperatures are displayed in "Monitor" program, "Status" tab, HDC/Head status
listbox.
User application can also obtain these values as a part of TAppHeadStatus structure via PiGetHeadStatus() or PiGetStatusEx() API.

Fields of TAppHeadStatus structure map to the real objects data as follows:

--- Head temperature is in degrees C multipiled by 10
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature1    Head temperature

--- Waveform amplifiers temperature is in degrees C multipiled by 10
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature2    Head side1 amplifier temperature
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature3    Head side2 amplifier temperature


---- this part of information is specific to HMB_2SB on PCC-Z.
This sort of hardware additionally reports information like PCC/Amplifiers voltages and consumption currents as follows:

TAppHeadStatus::Voltages[0]  PCC consumption current, ma           
TAppHeadStatus::Voltages[1]  PCC supply voltage, 10x scaled        
TAppHeadStatus::Voltages[2]  Amplifiers supply voltage, 10x scaled 
TAppHeadStatus::Voltages[3]  Amplifiers current, ma                
TAppHeadStatus::Voltages[4]  EE leakage current, uA
