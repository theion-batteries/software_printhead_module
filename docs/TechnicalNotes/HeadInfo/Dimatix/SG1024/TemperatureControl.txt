    Some information regarding temperature control for Dimatic SG1024 ("Starfire") head
=================================================================================================


Starfire HDC supports 2 temperature control channels:

    1. Head tempearure control.
       Starfire head has a built-in thermistor and a heater. So, HDC tries to keep head temperature equal to 
       set temperature. Head terget temperature is specified in a config file as follows:
       Default value 0 means that head temperature control is turned OFF.
       Valid range of this parameters is [0..60] degrees C.   
       Head target/measured temperatures are displayed in Monitor->"Status" tab.


    2. "Aux" or "External" temperature control.

        HDC board has "Aux thermistor" connector where you can connect a thermistor (100K, B-const:3380)
        and it can also provide PWM signal to control external heater. 
        If configured, PWM output is mapped to GPIO1 (pin2 on GPIO connector on HDC board).
    
        Default value 0 means that AUX temperature control is turned OFF ang GPIO1 is now used for PWM output
        Valid range of this parameters is [0..60] degrees C.   

        Aux target/measured temperatures are displayed in Monitor->"Status" tab.
        



------------------ Legacy (not recommended any longer) way of setting head / aux target temperatures.
These legacy Head/Aux target temperature settings in config file apply to the whole system. i.e. to 
all heads on all HDCs. It is possible to assign individual target temperatures to different HDCs 
by using CCP_HEAD_TEMP (head target temperature) and CCP_AUX_TEMP (Aux target temperature) parameters. 


    [Starfire]
    HeadTemperature = 46.8 ; Built in head heater target temperature (0 for no temp control)
    ExtTemperature  = 36.5 ; External heater target temperature (0 for no temp control)

------------------ Modern way of setting Head/Aux target temperatures.
There are now two ConfigEngine parameters that allow specifying Head(channel1) and Aux(channel2) target temperatures:

KPEX_TargetTemp, id:CPEX_TargetTemp, valid range:[0.0..60.0], def:0, scope:[DefaultParameterValues], [ControllerX], [HeadDriverX:Y]
KPEX_AuxTargetTemp, id:CPEX_AuxTargetTemp, valid range:[0.0..60.0], def:0, scope:[DefaultParameterValues], [ControllerX], [HeadDriverX:Y]



They can be used down to HDC level, allowing setting target temperatures for individual HDCs/Heads. For example:

    [DefaultParameterValues]      ;-- global default values for the WHOLE system
    HeadTargetTemperature = 22.3  ;-- target head temperature for ALL heads in the ssytem
    AuxTargetTemperature = 0;     ;-- 0 means "temperature control is disabled"

    [HeadDriver1:4] ;-- settings specific to the head on  PCC:1, HDC:4
    HeadTargetTemperature = 52.7  ;-- target head temperature for the head on PCC:1, HDC:4
    AuxTargetTemperature = 40.0;  ;-- target "Aux" temperature for the PCC:1, HDC:4



Using old "HeadTemperature" and new parameters in the config file is not recommended, this may lead to confusion.





------------------ Getting real heater temperatures

The real (measured) values of heads temperatures are displayed in "Monitor" program, "Status" tab, HDC/Head status listbox.
User application can also obtain these values as a part of TAppHeadStatus structure via PiGetHeadStatus() or PiGetStatusEx() API.

Fields of TAppHeadStatus structure map to the real objects data as follows:

--- Head temperature is in degrees C multipiled by 10
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature1    Head temperature
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature2    Aux temperature 
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature3    HDC Amplifier1 Temperature
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature4    HDC Amplifier2 Temperature
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature5    Head target temperature
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature6    Aux target temperature
TAppHeadStatus::HeaterPwm       High16 bits: Ext.Heater PWM value, Low16 bits: Head Heater PWM value.
