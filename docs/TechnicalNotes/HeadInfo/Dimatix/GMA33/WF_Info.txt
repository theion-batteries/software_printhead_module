Some information on the waveform files for Dimatix GMA heads.

=================================================================================================

Currently GMA and Samba waveforms seems to be identical.
For waveforms parameters, format description etc. see information in the "Samba" directory

Getting real head / amplifiers temperatures
=================================================================================================
The real (measured) values of head / amplifiers temperatures are displayed in "Monitor" program, "Status" tab, HDC/Head status
listbox.
User application can also obtain these values as a part of TAppHeadStatus structure via PiGetHeadStatus() or PiGetStatusEx() API.

Fields of TAppHeadStatus structure map to the real objects data as follows:

--- Head temperature is in degrees C multipiled by 10
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature1    Head temperature

--- Waveform amplifiers temperature is in degrees C multipiled by 10
TAppHeadStatus::Temperature2    Head amplifier temperature
