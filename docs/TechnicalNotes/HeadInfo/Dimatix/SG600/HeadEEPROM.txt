    Getting SG600 head EEPROM information
=================================================================================================

Some useful information, like head serial number etc. is written in head EEPROM and can be obtained in a form of 
JSON file via PiGetEepromData() API.


This information can also be obtained via TestApp. "Status" tab -> "Get Head EEPROM data" button.
Note that correct PCC/HDC numbers needs to be specified in the dropdown lists on the left.

Dimatix SG600 head has 6 "print modules" or Jetting Assemblies (JAs) in Meteor terminology, and 
every JA has its own EEPROM. Therefore there will be 6 portions of EEPROM information.

For example, the PiGetEepromData() output may look like:

{
  "#DataValid" : true,
  "#HeadType" : "HT_SG600",
  "#InfoType" : "Head EEPROM Data",
  "01-04-01-01" : 
  {
      "#DataValid" : true,
      "Cal_Voltage" : "100",
      "Date" : "032119",
      "DropMassOffset" : "-0.42",
      "EdgeToJet1_Dist" : "25.510",
      "FileFormat" : "04",
      "HeadPartNumber" : "2100309652",
      "NozzlePitch" : "64.979",
      "SerialNumber" : "16-00006608"
  },

   <... skipped ...>
    
  "01-04-01-06" : 
  {
    "#DataValid" : false
  }
}


Notes:
    - root key '"#DataValid" : true' means that whole head + HDC EEPROM has been read successfully.
    - root contains an array of structures with names like "01-04-01-01". The name specifies 
        PCC-HDC-Head-JA number and the structure itself contains decoded EEPROM data for the 
        given JA. There should be 6 such structures.

    - every JA structure in turn has its own "#DataValid" key that shows if JA EEPROM data is decoded successfully.
    - for fields meaning/format please refer head specs.
