Some information on reading and setting control signals for DataLase96 head.

=================================================================================================

--- reading signals value bits

It is possible to read some status signals out of the DataLase HDC.
These signals are mapped to THeadStatus::bmStatusBits as follows:

    Bit 3   - WaterFlow Alarm
    Bit 4   - Temperature Alarm
    Bit 5   - Psu On Alarm
    Bit 6   - Ready
    Bit 7   - Interlock
    Bit 12  - Enable
    Bit 13  - Chiller
    Bit 14  - KeySw
    Bit 15  - Extractor

These signal bits can be observed in "Monitor" program, "Status" tab, HDC/Head "Status Bits" fields.
Note that this 32-bit field can also contain other system flags, like BMHS_CFGEND (bit31). See BMHS_* constants.

User application can obtain  THeadStatus::bmStatusBits value as a part of TAppHeadStatus structure via 
PiGetHeadStatus() or PiGetStatusEx() API.


--- setting control signals

Following control signal bits defined and user application can set/reset them.

    Bit 0 : Stop
    Bit 1 : BoardRdy 
    Bit 2 : alarmReset
    Bit 3 : print
    Bit 4 : psuEn
    Bit 5 : Standby

This can be done by sending SIG_DLASE_CTRL signal to the specified PCC/HDC via PiSetSignal() API.
Parameters description:
    SigId: byte0: SIG_DLASE_CTRL (0x29), byte1: HDC number[1..8], byte2: PCC number[1..254], byte3:0
    State: byte0:       bit values (see bits definition above)
           bytes3..1:   must be 0

If some parameters are incorrect, then the signal is ignored and error message logged.

The signal value word is automatically read and displayed in "Monitor" program, "Status" tab, HDC/Head "Status Bits2" fields.
User application can obtain  THeadStatus::bmStatusBits2 value as a part of TAppHeadStatus structure via 
PiGetHeadStatus() or PiGetStatusEx() API.




For testing purposes this signal can be sent by "Meteor TestApp" as follows:
    - turn HDC power ON (e.g. from Monitor program/"Status" tab
    - connect "TestApp" to the PrintEngine
    - go to "Scratch" tab and find "PiSetSignal" box
    - in "Id" field enter [Jetting Assembly:PCC:HDC:Signal] fields (in hex!). E.g. for PCC1, Hdc4 and SIG_DLASE_CTRL (0x29)
        it should look like: "00:01:04:29"
    - in "Val" field enter the value (in decimal!) for example: 
        0   - will write all signals as '0'
        16  - will set bit4 "psuEn"
        48  - will set bits4,5 


    It is also a good idea to watch to the PrintEngine log to spot potential parameters errors and what is 
    being set.

    Log messages should look like:
    14:38:05.090 SetSignal: SIG_DLASE_CTRL (41) pcc:1 hnum:1 xaddr:0 state:0x0000000a
    14:38:05.090 SIG_DLASE_CTRL[00:00:ff:ff] Data:0xa
