    Some information regarding "Force white data functionality" for CF3/CK3 heads
=================================================================================================

It is possible to disable sending print data to a whole head or some parts of the head.
It is done on FPGA level, so, it also affects spitting. I.e. It might be possible to 
enable/disable ejecting ink for the whole head/HDC or individual nozzle rows.
This functionality is very head-type specific. Some print heads support it, some not.

To use it, an application should send SIG_FORCEWHITE to PrintEngine with some parameters.
For general information about signals, see  "Params_Signals.txt" technical note.
Some information on SIG_FORCEWHITE is also available in SDK documentation.


--- CF3/CK3 specific part:

API: PiSetSignal(uint32 SignalId, uint32 State)

Signal: SIG_FORCEWHITE
Parameters:


    * SignalId:                        
        Byte 3 - xAddr value: addresses the HDC part (see below)
        Byte 2 - PCC Number [1..255]
        Byte 1 - HDC Number [1..8] 
        Byte 0 - 0x1A (SIG_FORCEWHITE code)

    * State:  1  to disable printing (force white data for the objects selected by xAddr)
              0  to enable printing. (disables force white for the objects selected by xAddr)


    "xAddr" selects the HDC row (or whole HDC) to apply "force white data", as follows:
        * if its value is 0, then WHOLE HDC (both heads, 2 nozzle rows each) are addressed    

        * Bit0 set –  selects Head1 row A 
        * Bit1 set –  selects Head1 row B 
        * Bit2 set -  selects Head2 row A 
        * Bit3 set -  selects Head2 row B 

        * values > 0x0F are invalid

--- Example:

    SignalId = 0x0301011A, State=1 will cause disable printing on PCC:1, HDC:1, Head1 (both rows A&B)
