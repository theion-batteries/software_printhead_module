Some information on the waveform files for Xaar1001-1003 heads (HSS).

=================================================================================================

--- system configuration:

HDC drives one HSS (Xaar1001) head.
HSS head is made of 2 Nozzle Rows or Jetting Assemblies (JAs). 

----------------------- selecting head waveforms

By default the waveform selected in the HSS config file applies to all heads within the system.

It is possible to assign individual waveforms to a whole head on a given PCC:HDC
Unfortunately, it is not possible to achieve this using Meteor config file.
Instead, PiSetParam() API should be used for sending CCP_HEAD_WFILE_EX command. 

CCP_HEAD_WFILE_EX command has followig arguments:
     * PccNum - PCC Number  [1..254]  
     * HdcNum - HDC Number  [1..8]
     * "aNum" - Is not used here and should be 0 
     * Value  - WF file index.  



----------------------- Palette files
It is possible to use an optional palette to re-map grey level printed to a pixel value sent to the head.
By default, 1:1 palette mapping is used, i.e grey level0 is mapped to pixel value = 0, 
grey level1 is mapped to pixel value = 1, and so on.

Such palette is a property of the waveform and therefore is logically "attached" to a concrete waveform file.
Basically, if palette needs to be used, it should be placed in a "palette file", that has the same name as 
waveform file and ".plt" extension. It needs to be placed to the same directory where the WF file is.

For example, if we use WF file "SampleHssWaveform.txt", then its corresponding palette file will be 
"SampleHssWaveform.plt"

And its contents is just one line of the following values (for default mapping):

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
