    Some information on Xaar1001/1002/1003/1006 (HDC-HLM) temperatures     
=================================================================================================

Xaar1001,1002,1003 heads are driven by HDC-HLM. The heads themselves don't have any built-in thermistors and heaters.
Instead, HDC-HLM has one thermistor input (board connector marked as "Therm") and no temperature control outputs. 
So, it is only possible just to read external thermistor temperature.

Thermistor should have following parameters: 100K at 25C and B-const 3428.

This temperature is displayed in Monitor program ("Status" tab -> HDC pane) and can also be retrieved by 
user application as:

    TAppHeadStatus::Temperature1  ---> Ext.temperature, 10x scaled
