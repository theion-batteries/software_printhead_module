    Some information on Meteor "Tickling" and "Spitting" functionality.
=================================================================================================


---- Tickling.
This term describes the case when print head uses a special waveform/part of the waveform in order to agitate
ink in nozzles without actually jetting ink. 

Meteor supports two tickling modes that are inependent and can be used in any combination:

    * "Idle tickling"

        If configured, this mode turns on when there are no encoder pulses for about 200 milliseconds, 
        i.e. when print head is idle. In this mode a special "tickling" waveform is run with the frequency 
        specified in the config file.
        When encoder pulses are detected, then this mode is switched off and working waveform will be used 
        for printing.

        In order to enable this mode, Meteor config file should have following settings:

        ---

        [System]   ; settings for the whole system, i.e. ALL PCCs 
        Tickle = 1 ; Set to 1 to enable tickle.  Can also be set in [ControllerX] sections
        TickleFreqHz = 8000  ; Spit and tickle frequency

        [Controller7]  ; settings for PCC7       
        Tickle = 0 ; Disable tickling on PCC7

        ---

        Many head types support separate "tickling" waveform files, that are selected from the waveform 
        files list by parameter: "TickleWaveformFileIdx = ...". See "DefaultSamba_PccE.cfg" file for example.

        For quick tests these settings can be changed in TestApp->"Advanced" tab.

        User application can also use following signals to control this mode:

            SIG_SET_TICKLE_FREQ
            SIG_ENABLETICKLE

        You can also check "Params_Signals.txt" tech. note on how to send those signals from TestApp if 
        you want a quick experiment.        


    * "Tickling while printing"


        This mode works while normal printing, i.e. when encoder generates pulses. Usually print data with 
        grey level 0 ("white data") doesn't generate any ink jetting, but GL0 data is sent to the print head 
        anyway for blank areas in the image. So, it is possible to develop working waveform that has special
        "tickling pulse" assigned to GL0, not powerful enough to generate jetting, but good enough to agitate ink.

        This heavily depends on a head type, waveforms for some print heads (e.g Kyocera) already have 
        tickling pulses assigned to GL0, some heads allow editing waveforms and creating any functionality 
        you want.             


    --- Notes on tickling/spitting frequency
    Absolute min/max values of tickling/spitting frequency are:
        min: 82Hz, max: 100KHz. Default frequency is 8000Hz
    Note that min/max values are limited by FPGA, whether some conctere print head supports such frequency is 
    another question.    
    
        

---- Spitting.

    In this mode print head fires every nozzle given amount of times using spitting frequency (see TickleFreqHz).
    For spitting Meteor sends print data with the max. grey level to the head.

    For quick tests spitting can be done by using TestApp->"Advanced" tab.
    User application can also use signal SIG_SPIT to control spitting.

    Note: when spitting by default print data sent to ALL heads on HDC and all head "Modules" or "jetting assemblies".
    In most of the cases it is enough. But it is possible to disable sending print data (including spitting) to 
    a particular print head on HDC or even part of the head. This can be done by sending SIG_FORCEWHITE.
    But this functionality is very head-type specific, please refer to the concrete head tech. notes.

    Also, some print head types implement "spitting when prinitg" or "PageSpit". In this mode head can do a number 
    of small spits even when printing real images. This is quite specific feature and it is implemented mostly for 
    Ricoh Gen5 series.
